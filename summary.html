<h4><a href="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/2018-08-27-fork-in-the-road.html">A fork in the road for Mitogen</a></h4>
<p>
<p><a href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ansible.html">Mitogen for Ansible</a>'s
original plan described facets of a scheme centered on features made possible
by a rigorous single cohesive distributed program model, but of those facets,
it quickly became clear that most users are really only interested in the big
one: a much faster Ansible.</p>
<p>While I'd prefer feature work, this priority is fine: better performance
usually entails enhancements that benefit the overall scheme, and improving
people's lives in this manner is highly rewarding, so incentives remain
aligned. It is impossible not to find renewed energy when faced with comments
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
    Enabling the mitogen plugin in ansible feels like switching from floppy to SSD<br />
    <a href="https://t.co/nCshkioX9h">https://t.co/nCshkioX9h</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Although feedback on the project has been very positive, the existing solution
is sometimes not enough. Limitations in the extension and Ansible really bite,
most often manifesting when running against many targets. In these scenarios,
it is heartbreaking to see the work fail to help those who could benefit from
it most, and that's what I'd like to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Controller-side Performance</strong></p>
<p>Some time ago I began refactoring Ansible's
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/user_guide/playbooks_strategies.html">linear</a>
strategy, aiming to get it to where controller-side enhancements might exist
without adding more spaghetti, while becoming familiar with requirements for
later features. To recap, the strategy plugin is responsible for almost every
post-parsing task, including worker management. It is in many ways the beating
heart at the core of every Ansible run.</p>
<p>After some months and one particularly enlightening conversation that work was
resumed, eventually subsuming all of the remaining strategy support and result
processing code, forming one huge refactor of a big chunk of upstream that has
been gathering dust for almost a month.</p>
<p>The result exists today and is truly wonderful. It integrates Mitogen into the
heart of Ansible without baking it in, introduces a carefully designed process
model with strong persistence properties, eliminating most bottlenecks endured
by the extension and vanilla Ansible, and provides an architectural basis for
the next planned iteration of scalability work, Windows compatibility, some
features mentioned, and quite a few that have been kept quiet.</p>
<p>With the new strategy it is possible to almost perfectly saturate an 8 vCPU
machine given 100 targets, with minimal loss of speedup compared to
single-target. Regarding single target, simple loops against localhost are up
to 4x faster than the current stable extension.</p>
<p>While there are at least 2 obvious additional enhancements possible with this
work, development reached a natural break in order to allow stablizing one
piece of the puzzle at a time. Once this is done, it is clear exactly where to
pick things up next.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Cuts</strong></p>
<p><img width="162" height="405" src="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/images/ansible-stack.svg" align="right" /></p>
<p>There's just a small hitch: this work goes deep, entailing changes that, while
so far would be possible as monkey-patches, are highly version-specific, and
unlikely to remain monkey-patchable as the branch receives real-world usage.
There must be a mechanism to ship unknown future patches to upstream code.</p>
<p>It was hoped it could land after Ansible 2.7, benefitting from related changes
planned upstream, but they appear to have been delayed or abandoned, and so a
situation exists where improvements cannot be shipped for at least another 4-6
months, assuming the related changes finally arrived in Ansible 2.8.</p>
<p>To the right is a rough approximation of components involved in executing a
playbook. Those modified or replaced by the stable extension are green, yellow
are replaced by the branch-in-waiting. Finally in orange are components
affected by planned features and optimizations.</p>
<p>Although there are tens of thousands of lines of surrounding code, as should
hopefully be clear, the number of untouched major components involved in a run
has been dwindling fast. Put simply, the existing mechanism for delivering
improvements is reaching its limit.</p>
<p><strong>The F Word</strong></p>
<p>Any seasoned developer, especially those familiar with the size of the Ansible
code base, will hopefully understand the predicament. There is no problem
delivering improvements today, assuming an unsupported one-off code dump was
all anyone wanted, but that is never the case.</p>
<p>The problem lies in entering an unsustainable permanent marriage with a large
project, not forgetting this outcome was an explicit non-goal from the start.
Simultaneously over the months significant trust has been garnered to deliver
these kinds of improvements, and abandoning one of the best yet would seem
foolish.</p>
<p>Something of a many-variabled optimization process has recently come to an end,
and I've found a solution that I am comfortable with. While making a release
needs more time and may still not be definite, it seemed worth documenting at
least some of the reasoning behind it before it comes.</p>
<p>Even though this outcome was undesirable, and although the solution in mind is
not without restraint, it is still a cloud with many silver linings. For
instance, new user configuration steps can be reduced to almost zero, core
features can be added with minimal friction, and creative limitations are
significantly uncapped.</p>
<p>The key question was how to sustain continued work on a solution that has clear
value to a real problem that plagued upstream since conception. The answer it
turns out, is obvious: the scalability fixes due for release primarily benefit
one type of user.</p>
<p><strong>What about upstream?</strong></p>
<p>Beyond debating strawmen and lines of code, no actionable outcome has ever
materialized, not after carefully worded chain rattling, and not even in the
form of a bug report. If it had, it was always going to at best be a compromise
with an organization that has <a href="https://www.nexedi.com/blog-Improve.the.performance.of.Ansible">delivered consistently worsening performance
every major
release</a> for
the past two and a half years, and it is the principal reason crowdfunding the
extension was the only viable method to deliver real improvements.</p>
<p>The cold reality is that the upstream trend is not a good one: this problem has
existed forever and it is gradually getting worse over time. My best estimate
is that some veterans dislike the solution, perhaps some of those around since
2012 when Michael DeHaan, the project founder, first attempted a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/ansible-project/FRKMlsLQpNM/T0X0kQWYckIJ">connection
method uncannily similar to today's
design</a>.</p>
<p>In any case they have an e-mail address, an existing thread to hit Reply to,
and at least two invitations to a telephone call. A conversation requires
interest and initiative, and above all else it requires two parties.</p>
<p><strong>What About The Extension?</strong></p>
<p>The planned structure keeps the extension front-and-centre, so regardless of
outcome it will continue to receive the majority of feature work and
maintenance. It is definitely not going away.</p>
<p>With a third stable release looming, it's probably high time for a quick
update. Many bugs were squashed since July, with stable work recently centered
around problems with Ansible 2.6. This involved some changes to temporary file
handling, and in the process, discovery of a huge missed optimization.</p>
<p>v0.2.3 will need only 2 roundtrips for each
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/copy_module.html">copy</a> and
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/template_module.html">template</a>,
or in terms of a 250ms transcontinental link, 10 seconds to copy 20 files vs.
30 seconds previously, or 2 minutes compared to vanilla's best configuration.
This work is delayed somewhat as a new RPC chaining mechanism is added to
better support all similar future changes, and identical situations likely to
appear in similar tools.</p>
<p><strong>Just tuning in?</strong></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/08/27/computing-fingering-distance-with-dr-levenshtein/">Computing Fingering Distance with Dr. Levenshtein</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Jumping off after our previous two articles on <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">Voice Leading with Elixir</a>, and <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/08/13/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/">Algorithmically Fingering Guitar Chords with Elixir</a>, we’re left with a series of chord voicings ranked according to how well they voice lead from our starting chord, and the set of all possible fingerings for each of these voicings.</p>

<p>Given that our starting chord has a known fingering, which fingering of each of these “best” voicings is the “easiest” to play after our starting chord?</p>

<p>This is an interesting question, and gives us the opportunity to flex our algorithmic muscles again. This time we’ll be basing our solution on a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">the Levenshtein distance algorithm</a> for finding the “edit distance” between two strings.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-fingering-distance">What is “Fingering Distance”?</h2>

<p>The term “fingering distance” is my way of referring to how difficult it is to transition from playing one chord on the guitar to another. For example, going from playing a Dm chord on the middle four strings to an Em chord is easy. We just have to slide the shape up two frets.</p>

<p>However, starting on that same Dm chord and playing an Em chord on the top four strings is a more difficult transition. We need to change positions on the fretboard, and every finger in the chord needs to be moved.</p>

<hr />

<p>The family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance">“edit distance” algorithms</a> tackles a similar problem. How difficult is it to transform one string into another, given a set of operations with fixed costs?</p>

<p>The Levenshtein distance algorithm is an example of an “edit distance” algorithm with three operations: insertion, deletion, and substitution. The Levenshtein distance between <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">kitten</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sitting</span></code> is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">3</span></code>, where the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">k</span></code> is substituted for an <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">s</span></code>, and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">e</span></code> is substituted for <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">i</span></code>, and the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">g</span></code> is inserted at the end of the word.</p>

<p>In the classic Levenshtein distance algorithm each of the three basic operations has a unit cost (a cost of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code>). <a href="https://twitter.com/eugico/status/1029129770271993857">This doesn’t always have to be the case</a>. We can modify the algorithm to use our own set of operations, like “place finger”, “lift finger”, “move finger”, and “slide finger” to model how we transition from one chord to another. These operations might have a variable weight, depending on the operation and how far each finger has to move:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Placing and lifting a finger both seem similarly difficult. Let’s give both of these operations a constant unit cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moving from the fifth fret, fifth string to the fifth fret, fourth string seems fairly simple, but moving from the fifth fret, fifth string to the second fret, third string would be more difficult. We’ll give the “move finger” operation a weight dependent on the distance we have to move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sliding a finger up or down a string seems to be special sub-case of the “move finger” operation. I would argue that sliding a finger from any fret to any other fret on a string is roughly the same difficult. We’ll give the “slide finger” operation a constant unit cost.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s use this as a jumping off point for building our “fingering distance” calculator.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-fingering-distance">Calculating Fingering Distance</h2>

<p>Let’s start by defining a new module that will hold our new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord.Distance.Fingering do
  def distance(chord, chord),
    do: 0
end
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, if we pass in two identical chords, the distance between them is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>.</p>

<p>A more interesting case occurs when we’re comparing a chord with one or more notes to an empty list. The total distance between these two “chords” is our “place finger” cost applied to each of the remaining notes in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(chord, []),
  do:
    chord
    |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
    |&gt; length
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll need to handle the inverse case as well:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance([], chord),
  do:
    chord
    |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
    |&gt; length
</code></pre>

<p>The real meat of the algorithm comes into play when it’s time to determine the distance between two non-empty chords:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance([note_a | rest_a] = chord_a, [note_b | rest_b] = chord_b),
  do:
    Enum.min([
      distance(rest_a, chord_b) + 1,
      distance(chord_a, rest_b) + 1,
      distance(rest_a, rest_b) + note_distance(note_a, note_b)
    ])
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function is recursive. At every level of recursion, we calculate the distance required to transform <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_a</span></code> into <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_b</span></code> by first:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lifting a finger from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_a</span></code>.</li>
  <li>Lifting a finger from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_b</span></code>.</li>
  <li>Moving <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">note_a</span></code> to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">note_b</span></code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The initial choice with the lowest final cost is the choice we pick. Our decision ripples up through our stack until we’re left with the final, minimal cost of transitioning from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_a</span></code> to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_b</span></code>.</p>

<p>Thank you, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Levenshtein">Dr. Levenshtein</a>!</p>

<h2 id="calculating-note-distance">Calculating Note Distance</h2>

<p>As we’ve seen, both placing and lifting a finger have constant unit costs. The real magic of our fingering distance algorithm happens in the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">note_distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function, where we calculating the cost of moving fingers between frets ands strings.</p>

        </form>
    </div>
</div>

<p>We’ll start with some trivial base cases. If the two notes we’re comparing are the same, the distance between them is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance(note, note),
  do: 0
</code></pre>

<p>If the first “note” is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>, we’re actually being asked for the cost of placing a finger:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance(nil, _),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, if the second “note” is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>, we’re being asked how much it costs to lift a finger:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance(_, nil),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>Now things are getting interesting. If we’re asked for the distance between two notes that live on the same string, we’ll report back the unit cost, as we discussed earlier:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance({_, _, string}, {_, _, string}),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>However, if the two notes live on different strings, we’ll treat out guitar’s fretboard like a grid, or city block, and return the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">“manhattan distance”</a> between the two notes:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance({fret_a, _, string_a}, {fret_b, _, string_b}),
  do: abs(fret_a - fret_b) + abs(string_a - string_b)
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s really all there is to it.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-examples">A Few Examples</h2>

<p>Going back to our previous examples, going from our Dm on the middle four string set to an Em on the same string should have a cost of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">4</span></code>. We’re just sliding each finger up two frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.Distance.Fingering.distance(
  [nil, {5, 1}, {7, 3}, {7, 4}, {6, 2}, nil],
  [nil, {7, 1}, {9, 3}, {9, 4}, {8, 2}, nil]
)
</code></pre>

<p>And we do get <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">4</span></code>!</p>

<p>The cost of transitioning from that same Dm chord to an Em on the upper four string set should be higher than <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">4</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.Distance.Fingering.distance(
  [nil, {5, 1}, {7, 3}, {7, 4}, {6, 2}, nil],
  [nil, nil, {2, 1}, {4, 3}, {5, 4}, {3, 2}]
)
</code></pre>

<p>And it is! We get a distance of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">6</span></code>.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-best-chord">The Next Best Chord</h2>

<p>And now for the grand finale. Let’s say we want to find the set of Cmaj7 voicings that have the best voice leading between our starting G7 chord. This is old hat from our previous articles:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[0, 4, 7, 11]
|&gt; Chord.voicings(4)
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;{Chord.Distance.Semitone.distance(&amp;1, [nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil]), &amp;1})
|&gt; Enum.uniq()
|&gt; Enum.sort()
|&gt; Enum.chunk_by(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 0))
|&gt; List.first()
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 1))
</code></pre>

<p>But now let’s take each of those voicings and find the best fingering for each with regards to how we’re fingering our G7 chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(fn chord -&gt;
  chord
  |&gt; Chord.fingerings()
  |&gt; Enum.uniq()
  |&gt; Enum.map(
    &amp;{Chord.Distance.Fingering.distance(&amp;1, [nil, {10, 1}, {12, 3}, {10, 1}, {12, 4}, nil]), &amp;1}
  )
  |&gt; Enum.sort()
  |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 1))
  |&gt; List.first()
end)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we’ll take each fingered chord and render it to the console:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/computing-fingering-distance-with-dr-levenshtein/1.png" />
  <p>Our final chords.</p>

<p>Awesome!</p>

<h4><a href="https://theta.eu.org/2018/08/27/data-retention.html">Data retention</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I don’t use any social media (apart from <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, which I briefly flirted with for a while earlier
this year before letting the accounts I’d made fall into disuse). I have many reasons, and the arguments against social media have been
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/23/never-get-high-on-your-own-supply-why-social-media-bosses-dont-use-social-media">done</a>
<a href="http://en.arguman.org/social-media-are-an-overall-benefit-to-society">to</a>
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180104-is-social-media-bad-for-you-the-evidence-and-the-unknowns">death</a>,
so I won’t bother restating them here - apart from one. I think it’s important to consider the effect social media - and other technologies! -
have on the amount of data we produce, and whether or not having all of this data around is a good thing.</p>

<p>If you do use social media, you likely produce quite a bit of data about yourself on a semi-regular basis. If you’re really eager, your profiles
may be an hourly blow-by-blow of your feelings, thoughts, and experiences; if you aren’t, your profile may be a little more relaxed and pensive.
The social media companies care about this data - after all, that’s why they’re giving you the social media service for free - but do you?
For most people, I’d wager that the utility of the data on their social media profile probably decreases as time goes on - what you thought
about your lunch today or yesterday may be interesting, especially if people are still replying to it, but you likely have zero interest
in what you had for lunch 50 days ago. Indeed, on today’s modern platforms, you’d probably have to do a fair amount of clicking through pages
of data in order to access the stuff you posted 50 years ago (again, this varies with posting frequency), so you likely don’t worry about it.
Nobody looks at that stuff, right?</p>

<p>Well, not quite right. Search engines, for example, are notorious for crawling through every word you’ve ever posted online and making it easily
accessible. Advertising and analytics companies analyse your posts, looking for clues that you might be interested in their brand new product
in order to serve you more relevant ads. Facebook itself occasionally sends you reminders about what you did a long time ago, in the interest
of injecting ‘blasts from the past’ into your timeline to make it somewhat more interesting.</p>

<p>The thing is, though, my original statement was partially right. No <em>human</em> looks at that stuff - this kind of data-trawling is a pretty new
activity that people have never really bothered or managed to do. If you weren’t someone who should have a place in the history books, most
minutiae about your life would be very quickly forgotten and lost, irreversibly, in the sands of time. After all,
nobody has a memory good enough to remember what you said two years ago today,
much less any caring for what happened then. As humans, we naturally forget about things that aren’t relevant - it’s part of keeping us sane,
after all. As the learning process of <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a> tries to combat, memory retention has a
natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">‘forgetting curve’</a> that prioritizes information we see more frequently, or information
that is relevant to us, whilst trashing the rest.</p>

<p>And, of course, sometimes things that might seem irrelevant to you might be stupendously relevant to someone else. If you manage to annoy someone
on the internet, they now have an unprecedented corpus of information with which to effect your downfall; there’s usually something you posted on
social media once in your life that you probably wouldn’t want to widely publicize, yet it’s now possible for angry blackmail-searchers to do just
that. This works excellently in conjunction with how hard it is to unambiguously convey tone on the internet - as
inimitable Rust contributor <em>brson</em> exemplifies in <a href="https://brson.github.io/2017/04/05/minimally-nice-maintainer">The Minimally-Nice Open Source Software Maintainer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s well understood that conveying tone on the internet is hard:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Thanks.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What does that period mean? It looks so gruff. Are they pissed at me?! Are they having a bad day? On the internet the simple period can appear
sarcastic, or angry. It’s so neutral that people will project whatever emotions they want on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or you could take <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/pl/minor_differences/smiley">this example</a> from The Oatmeal, demonstrating how simple punctuation can
vastly change meaning:</p>

<p><img src="https://theta.eu.org/assets/img/with_smiley.jpg" alt="The Oatmeal comic" />
<img src="https://theta.eu.org/assets/img/without_smiley.jpg" alt="The Oatmeal comic" /></p>

<p>A more fundamental reason to worry about your data is the fact that your data is <em>yours</em>; it’s your property, so you should be able to do what
you like with it. If your social media posts were handwritten letters, how would you organize them? Would you throw them all in the bin
after a while, or would you keep the ones you liked and bin the rest? If a bunch of your letters were kept in a box in your friend Twitter’s house,
would you go and get them eventually? How long would you leave your stuff there? We don’t tend to treat digital data in this way - but sorting through
your digital life should probably occupy as much time as sorting through things in your physical life. If you’re the sort of person who bins
everything after they’re done with it, why not do that online as well? On the flipside, if you <em>do</em> like keeping mementos of the past for your
future self, why not spend some time doing that same curation process with your digital things?</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with some words from <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2017-04-27_Record_Keeping">this very similar blog post by Alex Schroeder</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] We are built to forget the information that is not relevant. Forgetting is important.</p>

  <p>The alternative, the thing that we’re building right now, the default future if you will, is the exact opposite.
We’re building a panopticon where the rich and powerful can keep watch on us, where surveillance capitalism reaps the fruit of our data
and we can’t trust a single website. […]</p>

<p>
Introduction This week, we continue to look at data processing patterns used to build event triggered stream processing applications, the use cases that the patterns relate to, and how you would go about implementing within Wallaroo.
This purpose of these posts is to help you understand the data processing use cases that Wallaroo is best designed to handle and how you can go about building them right away.
I will be looking at the Wallaroo application builder, the part of your application that hooks into the Wallaroo framework, and some the business logic of the pattern.</p>

<h4><a href="https://blog.zacbrown.org/2018/08/23/things-i-learned-about-rust-1-of-n">Things I Learned About Rust (1 of N)</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Rust has been a daily part of my life for about 8 months now. I’ve had the distinct and somewhat surprising pleasure of getting to work with it professionally for Red Canary. It’s been a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Every so often, I learn something new about writing Rust. Most recently, that was over-use of <code>match</code> statements. In particular, my code base has a number of cases where I’m dealing with the <code>Result&lt;V, E&gt;</code> type. I need to decompose the <code>Result&lt;V, E&gt;</code> into its constituent <code>Ok(v)</code> and <code>Err(e)</code> variants in order to branch logic.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of places where I use a result type similar to: <code>Result&lt;(), SomeError&gt;</code>. This results in a bunch of code that looks like:</p>
<p><a id="poor_match_statement"></a></p>
<pre><code>let foo: Result&lt;(), SomeError&gt; = something_that_returns_result();
match foo {
    Ok(_) =&gt; {},
    Err(e) =&gt; println!(&quot;My error: {}&quot;, e.description())
}</code></pre>
<p>Initially, I didn’t think to hard about writing that. It was short enough and the intent was clear to me. After starting to use <code>cargo clippy</code> fastidiously on my code base, it kept pointing out ways to simplify the use of the inverse pattern above for the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type:</p>
<pre><code>let foo: Option&lt;String&gt; = something_that_returns_option();
match foo {
    Some(v) =&gt; do_a_thing_with_string(v),
    None =&gt; {}
}</code></pre>
<p><code>cargo clippy</code> kindly informed me that I should be using the <code>if let...</code> syntax instead of match for brevity:</p>
<pre><code>if let Some(foo) = something_that_returns_option() {
    do_a_thing_with_string(foo);
}</code></pre>
<p>After fixing a few of the <code>cargo clippy</code> lint issues <a href="https://blog.zacbrown.org/feed.rss#poor_match_statement">above</a>, I realized I could do the same thing with those functions I used which returned <code>Result&lt;(), SomeError&gt;</code>, just the inverse:</p>
<pre><code>if let Err(e) = something_that_returns_result() {
    println!(&quot;My error: {}&quot;, e.description();
}</code></pre>
<p>That’s clearer and simplifies the thinking in my opinion.</p>
<p><span class="small-caps">PS</span>: Maybe I should look at adding the inverse pattern to <code>cargo clippy</code> as a feature addition to that lint rule.</p></p>

<h4><a href="https://sulami.github.io/Pipes in PythonPipes in Python">Pipes in Python</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I just found <a href="https://hackernoon.com/adding-a-pipe-operator-to-python-19a3aa295642">an article about pipes in Python</a> on lobste.rs and was reminded that I was toying with the exact same thing recently. Using a lot of functional languages (mainly Haskell, Clojure, Elixir)<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">… but being paid to write (mostly highly object-oriented) Python four out of five days a week. We do use some Elixir at my place, but we are still a Python shop first.<br />
<br />
</span></span> and also a fair bit of bash, I am very used to streaming data through chains of functions using pipe-like constructs. Python does make this quite difficult and encourages a more imperative approach with intermediate variables.</p>
<p>The author of the article above uses AST rewriting, which I have to admit is very clever, though hard to introspect and extend unless you are already familiar with AST manipulation in Python.</p>
<p>My approach is slightly different, and yields a less pretty syntax, but is arguably more flexible and extensible, by using a plain function. The definition currently looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> pype(x, <span class="op">*</span>fs):
    <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="co">    Pipe function. Takes an initial value and any number of functions/methods.</span>
<span class="co">    Methods as strings. Additional args are supported for functions &amp; methods</span>
<span class="co">    by suppling a step as a tuple/list with function/method as the first</span>
<span class="co">    element and the args as the rest. The pipe input is used as the last</span>
<span class="co">    argument in this case. Currently no kwargs.</span>
<span class="co">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="cf">while</span> fs:
        f <span class="op">=</span> fs[<span class="dv">0</span>]
        args <span class="op">=</span> []
        <span class="cf">if</span> <span class="bu">isinstance</span>(f, (<span class="bu">list</span>, <span class="bu">tuple</span>)):
            args <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">list</span>(f[<span class="dv">1</span>:])
            f <span class="op">=</span> f[<span class="dv">0</span>]
        <span class="cf">if</span> <span class="bu">isinstance</span>(f, <span class="bu">str</span>):
            <span class="cf">if</span> f.startswith(<span class="st">'.'</span>):
                x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">getattr</span>(x, f[<span class="dv">1</span>:])(<span class="op">*</span>args)
            <span class="cf">else</span>:
                x <span class="op">=</span> x[f]
        <span class="cf">elif</span> <span class="bu">isinstance</span>(f, <span class="bu">int</span>):
            x <span class="op">=</span> x[f]
        <span class="cf">else</span>:
            x <span class="op">=</span> f(<span class="op">*</span>args <span class="op">+</span> [x])
        fs <span class="op">=</span> fs[<span class="dv">1</span>:]
    <span class="cf">return</span> x</code></pre></div>
<p>The docstring is a bit abstract, so I think an example is much more explanatory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="im">from</span> pype <span class="im">import</span> pype

<span class="kw">def</span> add_suffix(number, s):
    <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="st">'</span><span class="sc">{}</span><span class="st"> is </span><span class="sc">{}</span><span class="st"> cool!'</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(
        s,
        <span class="st">' '</span>.join(<span class="st">'very'</span> <span class="cf">for</span> _ <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="bu">range</span>(number))
    )

pype(
    <span class="st">'   abc: </span><span class="sc">{}</span><span class="st">   '</span>,
    <span class="st">'.strip'</span>,
    (<span class="st">'.format'</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>),
    (add_suffix, <span class="dv">2</span>),
    <span class="st">'.upper'</span>,
)

<span class="co"># 'ABC: 3 IS VERY VERY COOL!'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I am aware this is a very constructed example, but you get the idea. It currently does not handle keyword arguments, and you cannot specify in which place you would like the input argument to go, it always takes the last slot, which isn’t always convenient, but this way you can avoid using <code>lambda</code>s everywhere, which are quite long in Python<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I quite enjoy Elixir’s solution: <code>&amp;func(1, &amp;1, 3)</code>, <code>&amp;1</code> being the placeholder.<br />
<br />
</span></span>.</p>
<p>I might extend this further in the future and maybe introduce it into some code bases of mine, if it turns out to be useful.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/08/20/coffee-tea-and-theanine/">Coffee, Tea, and Theanine</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I’ve always had a tumultuous relationship with caffeine. When I was younger I would drink gallons of diet soda a day (sometimes literally). As I grew older I discovered coffee and increased my caffeine consumption by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>It took me until I was nearly thirty years old to realize that my consumption of huge amounts of caffeine was probably related to a low-level background radiation of anxiety that I’d been experiencing nearly my entire life. In an effort to better myself, I tried cutting back on coffee and even quitting altogether. I always found it difficult to restrict myself to one or even two cups a day, and quitting was always unsuccessful for one reason or another.</p>

<p>At that point, I decided that my current relationship with coffee was unhealthy, so I decided to try switching to tea. I quickly went whole hog into the tea world. I bought myself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaiwan">a gaiwan</a>, and started buying tea from amazing import companies like <a href="https://what-cha.com/">What-Cha</a> and <a href="http://white2tea.com/about/">white2tea</a>.</p>

  <p>Tea in a gaiwan.</p>
</div>

<p>I loved it! What’s more, <em>I felt better.</em> My anxiety lessened, I felt less dependent on it every morning, and I didn’t feel like I was chasing the daily “buzz” like I would with coffee.</p>

<p>Recently I started drinking more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu%27er_tea">pu-erh teas</a>, which are a style of tea where the leaves are fermented before being pressed into cakes. As I started to drink pu-erh more consistently, I began to notice my anxiety levels begin to ramp up. Once again, I found myself having cup after cup, trying to catch a caffeine buzz. Something was different. I decided to look into the differences between pu-erh and other types of teas.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4787341/">this 2016 study</a> carried out by the Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Szeged, Hungary, who’s goal was to compare the correlations of caffeine and tea contents between a variety of tea processing techniques.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caffeine and L-theanine are pharmacologically important constituents of tea, especially due to their effects on the central nervous system. The effects of these two compounds are opposite: While caffeine is a well-known stimulant, theanine has a relaxing effect. Tea processing may influence the caffeine and theanine content of tea leaves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While a sampled set of white, green, oolong, black, and pu-erh teas all contained similar levels of caffeine, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine">L-theanine</a> content in the pu-erh samples tested were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4787341/#ui-ncbiinpagenav-heading-8">“practically zero.”</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The average theanine concentration of oolong samples was 6.09 mg/g with a mean caffeine level of 19.31 mg/g (caffeine/theanine ratio 4.20). In the pu-erh tea, no theanine was detected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So maybe it’s not a reduction in caffeine that’s improving my quality of life. Maybe it’s the introduction of theanine. Either way, I’ve decided to drop the pu-erh for now and go back to drinking oolongs.</p>

<p>It’s said that programmers “turn caffeine into code.” How’s your relationship with coffee, tea, and caffeine, and how does it affect your life and career?</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WaitingForTheJobsToFinish/~3/Qo5NEjgdXho/my-apple-watch-killed-my-iphone.html">My Apple Watch killed my iPhone</a></h4>
<p>
<p>This is the incredibly weird chain of bugs and hardware issues that bricked my iPhone after the battery of my Apple Watch started to swell.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago the battery of my 1st gen Apple Watch started to swell and the screen popped out. I googled about this issue and read that it's covered by a warranty program, so I brought the watch to the Apple Store in Barcelona. The watch got serviced in a few days, excellent customer support as usual by Apple. </p>

<p>I got home and tried to link this new watch to my iPhone 5s. For some reason the watch refused to link unless I upgraded iOS 10 to iOS 11 on my phone. </p>

<p>My old watch had been working perfectly with iOS 10, but apparently this refurbished one had a new software version that required iOS 11 to work.</p>

<p>I had kept my phone at iOS 10 because my 5s is a bit slow nowadays, I don't need the new features, and in general prefer stability on my main devices. I think, it can't be that bad, and furthermore I had missed my watch so much these last days, so I decide to upgrade.</p>

<p>Terrible decision.</p>

<p>I tap on "Upgrade". The phone downloads the upgrade, starts installing it, progress bar, reboot, progress bar, reboot... one too many times. It's stuck on a reboot look around 80% of progress. Ok, two options, I think. Hardware issue or software issue. How could it be hardware? The phone was working well up to ten minutes ago. So I decide to install clean, wiping out all my data</p>

<p>It's now late afternoon and next day I have to work, and need the phone. You know that feeling, right? This won't end well. I do a clean install, set up Whatsapp and Google Maps, hoping to restore from an icloud backup next day while at work.</p>

<p>The clean install lets me reach the iOS 11 setup screen. Set up wifi, tap next, and reboot. Damn. Set up wifi again, reboot. This doesn't look like a software issue. I try something... I wait five minutes on the wifi setup screen without touching anything. Surprisingly, the phone does not reboot.</p>

<p>I set up wifi after these five minutes and the phone reboots instantly. Any electrical engineer (or probably most of you here that's read about batteries and iOS 11) knows what's happening by now. The battery is failing to supply enough voltage, and this is made apparent at peak power demand, that is, when antennas are working and CPU is at max. I resign myself to having no phone for the next day.</p>

<p>Then, I realize I have a spare iPhone 5s battery laying around, One that I bought to replace my mother's battery (she has also an iPhone 5s) but never ended up fixing. I've changed batteries maybe a dozen times before, and work with electronics regularly. I know best practices. I ground myself, pick up the screwdrivers and suction cup, open up the iPhone carefully, remove the battery glue strips, and install the new battery.</p>

<p>The phone boots.</p>

<p>With the new battery I finally manage to get past the wifi screen but unfortunately the phone keeps rebooting randomly when accessing networks. Damn. My phone clearly has an electrical problem and for whatever reason iOS 11 triggered it. Later, when discussing this issue when a Genius, they confirmed that this is a motherboard problem which required an expensive repair.</p>

<p>Back to the 5S. Since I couldn't use a phone that dies on me randomly, and it's late at night, I picked up my old 4S, popped in my SIM, quickly downloaded Whatsapp and Maps, set up my work email and a few more apps, hoping all icloud data syncs over night. Fortunately, it did.</p>

<p>The next day I started using the 4S as my daily driver. I managed to stick with it for a month, but in the end, it was too slow for everyday usage. It was nice as an experiment, but a pain in the neck to work with.</p>

<p>That's the end more or less. I have a new Apple Watch that killed my 5S, which ironically I couldn't use because my replacement 4S wasn't compatible with that Watch.</p>

<p>I still don't know why iOS 11 draws more power than iOS 10, or if it was a firmware change that really killed my phone. But my bet is on battery management. Doesn't matter now. It was a disaster.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I ended up buying an SE, which is two years old, at full retail price. Well, I got a 40€ discount by trading in the broken 5S. </p>

<p>The <em>cheapest iPhone</em> is not a great deal nowadays, but it still is the perfect phone for my usage/size/budget.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to blame Apple. I fully understand what happened, and it was a chain of unfortunate events. However, I have the feeling that if I could have downgraded the 5S to iOS 10, it may have come back from the dead. </p>

<h4><a href="http://benaiah.me/posts/configuring-go-apps-with-toml">Configuring Go Apps with TOML</a></h4>
<p>
<h1>Configuring Go Apps with TOML</h1>
<p>So you’ve been writing an application in Go, and you’re getting to the
point where you have a lot of different options in your program.
You’ll likely want a configuration file, as specifying every option on
the command-line can get difficult and clunky, and launching
applications from a desktop environment makes specifying options at
launch even more difficult.</p>
<p>This post will cover configuring Go apps using a simple, INI-like
configuration language called <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>, as well as some related
difficulties and pitfalls.</p>
<p>TOML has quite a few implementations, including several libraries for
Go. I particularly like
<a href="https://github.com/burntsushi/toml">BurntSushi’s TOML parser and decoder</a>, as it lets
you marshal a TOML file directly into a struct. This means your
configuration can be fully typed and you can easily do custom
conversions (such as parsing a <code>time.Duration</code>) as you read the
config, so you don’t have to do them in the rest of your application.</p>
<h2>Configuration location</h2>
<p>The first question you should ask when adding config files to any app
is "where should they go?". For tools that aren’t designed to be run
as a service, as root, or under a custom user (in other words, most of
them), you should be putting them in the user’s home directory, so
they’re easily changed. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if you currently have only one file, you should use a folder
and put the config file within it. That way, if and when you do need
other files there, you won’t have to clutter the user’s home
directory or deal with loading config files that could be in two
different locations (Emacs, for instance, supports both
<code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> and <code>~/.emacs</code> for historical reasons, which
ends up causing confusing problems when both exist).</p></li>
<li><p>You should name your configuration directory after your program.</p></li>
<li><p>You should typically prefix your config directory with a <code>.</code> (but
see the final note for Linux, as configuration directories within
<code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> should not be so prefixed).</p></li>
<li><p>On most OSs, putting your configuration files in the user’s “home”
directory is typical. I recommend the library
<a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/go-homedir">go-homedir</a>, rather than the <code>User.Homedir</code> available
in the stdlib from <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/user/"><code>os/user</code></a>. This is because use of
<code>os/user</code> uses <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">cgo</a>, which, while useful in many situations,
also <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go">causes a number of difficulties</a> that can
otherwise be avoided - most notably, cross-compilation is no longer
simple, and the ease of deploying a static Go binary gets a number
of caveats.</p></li>
<li><p>On Linux specifically, I strongly encourage that you do <em>not</em> put
your configuration directory directly in the user’s home directory.
Most commonly-used modern Linux distributions use the
<a href="https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory Specification</a> from
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/">freedesktop.org</a>, which specifies standard locations
for various directories on an end-user Linux system. (Despite this,
many applications don’t respect the standard and put their
configurations directly in <code>~</code> anyway). By default, this is
<code>~/.config/</code>, but it can also be set with the <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>
environment variable. Directories within this should <em>not</em> use a
leading <code>.</code>, as the directory is already hidden by default.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following function should get you the correct location for your
config directory on all platforms (if there’s a platform with a
specific convention for config locations which I’ve missed, I’d
appreciate you letting me know so I can update the post - my email is
at the bottom of the page).</p>

        hiddenConfigDirName := "." + configDirName
        configDirLocation = filepath.Join(homeDir, hiddenConfigDirName)
    }

    return configDirLocation, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>Within the config folder, you can use any filename you want for your
config - I suggest <code>config.toml</code>.</p>
<h2>Loading the config file</h2>
<p>To load a config file, you’ll first want to define the what config
values you’ll use. <code>burntsushi/toml</code> will ignore options in the TOML
file that you don’t use, so you don’t have to worry about that causing
errors. For instance, here’s the proposed configuration for a project
I’m maintaining, <a href="https://github.com/asciimoo/wuzz">wuzz</a> (the keybindings aren’t currently
implemented, but I’ve left them in for the sake of demonstration):</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type Config struct {
    General GeneralOptions
    Keys    map[string]map[string]string
}

type GeneralOptions struct {
    FormatJSON             bool
    Insecure               bool
    PreserveScrollPosition bool
    DefaultURLScheme       string
}
</code></pre>
<p>It’s pretty simple. Note that we use a named struct for
<code>GeneralOptions</code>, rather than making <code>Config.General</code> an anonymous
struct. This makes nesting options simpler and aids tooling.</p>
<p>Loading the config is quite easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    "errors"
    "os"
    
    "github.com/BurntSush/toml"
)

func LoadConfig(configFile string) (*Config, error) {
    if _, err := os.Stat(configFile); os.IsNotExist(err) {
        return nil, errors.New("Config file does not exist.")
    } else if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    var conf Config
    if _, err := toml.DecodeFile(configFile, &amp;conf); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return &amp;conf, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>toml.DecodeFile</code> will automatically populate <code>conf</code> with the values
set in the TOML file. (Note that we pass <code>&amp;conf</code> to <code>toml.DecodeFile</code>,
not <code>conf</code> - we need to populate the struct we actually have, not a
copy). Given the above <code>Config</code> type and the following TOML file…</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[general]
defaultURLScheme = "https"
formatJSON = true
preserveScrollPosition = true
insecure = false

[keys]

  [keys.general]
  "C-j" = "next-view"
  "C-k" = "previous-view"
  
  [keys.response-view]
  "&lt;down&gt;" = "scroll-down"
</code></pre>
<p>…we’ll get a <code>Config</code> like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">Config{
    General: GeneralOptions{
        DefaultURLScheme:       "https",
        FormatJSON:             true,
        PreserveScrollPosition: true,
        Insecure:               false,
    },
    Keys: map[string]map[string]string{
        "general": map[string]string{
            "C-j": "next-view",
            "C-k": "previous-view",
        },
        "response-view": map[string]string{
            "&lt;down&gt;": "scroll-down",
        },
    },
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Automatically decoding values</h2>
<p><code>wuzz</code> actually uses another value in its config - a default HTTP
timeout. In this case, though, there’s no native TOML value that
cleanly maps to the type we want - a <code>time.Duration</code>. Fortunately, the
TOML library we’re using supports automatically decoding TOML values
into custom Go values. To do so, we’ll need a type that wraps
<code>time.Duration</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type Duration struct {
    time.Duration
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next we’ll need to add an <code>UnmarshalText</code> method, so we satisfy the
<code>toml.TextUnmarshaler</code> interface. This will let <code>toml</code> know that we
expect a string value which will be passed into our <code>UnmarshalText</code>
method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (d *Duration) UnmarshalText(text []byte) error {
    var err error
    d.Duration, err = time.ParseDuration(string(text))
    return err
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we’ll need to add it to our <code>Config</code> type. This will go in
<code>Config.General</code>, so we’ll add it to <code>GeneralOptions</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type GeneralOptions struct {
    Timeout                Duration
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can add it to our TOML file, and <code>toml.DecodeFile</code> will
automatically populate our struct with a <code>Duration</code> value!</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[general]
timeout = "1m"
# ...
</code></pre>
<p>Equivalent output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">Config{
    General: GeneralOptions{
        Timeout: Duration{
            Duration: 1 * time.Minute
        },
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Default config values</h2>
<p>We now have configuration loading, and we’re even decoding a text
field to a custom Go type - we’re nearly finished! Next we’ll want to
specify defaults for the configuration. We want values specified in
the config to override our defaults. Fortunately, <code>toml</code> makes really
easy to do.</p>
<p>Remember how we passed in <code>&amp;conf</code> to <code>toml.DecodeFile</code>? That was an
empty <code>Config</code> struct - but we can also pass one with its values
pre-populated. <code>toml.DecodeFile</code> will set any values that exist in the
TOML file, and ignore the rest. First we’ll create the default values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    "time"
)
var DefaultConfig = Config{
    General: GeneralOptions{
        DefaultURLScheme:       "https",
        FormatJSON:             true,
        Insecure:               false,
        PreserveScrollPosition: true,
        Timeout: Duration{
            Duration: 1 * time.Minute,
        },
    },
    // You can omit stuff from the default config if you'd like - in
    // this case we don't specify Config.Keys
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we simply modify the <code>LoadConfig</code> function to use
<code>DefaultConfig</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func LoadConfig(configFile string) (*Config, error) {
    if _, err := os.Stat(configFile); os.IsNotExist(err) {
        return nil, errors.New("Config file does not exist.")
    } else if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    conf := DefaultConfig
    if _, err := toml.DecodeFile(configFile, &amp;conf); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return &amp;conf, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>The important line here is <code>conf := DefaultConfig</code> - now when <code>conf</code>
is passed to <code>toml.DecodeFile</code> it will populate that.</p>

<h4><a href="https://blog.artemix.org/article/show/kickstart">Kickstart, a fast and simple project template bootstrapper</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Ever had some code base that you regularly use to start a new project?</p>
<p>Until now, you've probably lost some time refactoring everything to fill out the right project name, title etc.</p>
<p>A few tools already exist but either you're lost in feature bloating hell or you're fighting to configure everything in most cases.</p>
<p>The following tool is an early-developement, rust-based, template tool made to be more versatile that its closest python counter-part, <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a>.</p>
<p>Also, it perfectly works on Windows, Linux and MacOS without any issue!</p>
<h2>A demonstration</h2>
<p>Let me demonstrate this tool from a user's point of view.</p>
<p>Say I'm John. I have a need to make several workers for my job queue.</p>
<p>All workers follow the same base structure and only a few bits of code change.
Error management is the same, etc.</p>
<p>Without any external tool,
the easiest way I could handle that would be to put the template in a Git repository,
clone it when needed and change the few fields,
like the handler's class name, the configuration file etc.</p>
<p>Still, I'd like to quickly bootstrap all my workers and not have to, by hand,
replace each key with the right value.</p>
<p>At the same time, I'm too lazy to set up an entire boostrapping suite or tool,
and I'd like to be able to make some very basic project templates that'd work almost out of the box.</p>
<p>My example of worker system uses the following file structure for worker classes:</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">.
├── {{name}}.java
└── template.toml</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, this tool supports templating in file and folder names!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>{{name}}.java</code> file contains the following very basic template code:</p>
<pre><code class="java">package org.artemix.worker;

class {{name}} extends WorkerBase {
        public void handle(Payload payload) {
                // Some default code
        }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>template.toml</code> contains a few template-specific fields (like its name, description and configuration format version), but also variable declaration for setup prompts.</p>
<pre><code class="toml">name = "Worker"
description = "Worker base template"
kickstart_version = 1

[[variable]]
name="name"
default="MyClass"
prompt="Which class name do you want to give to your worker ?"
validation="^[A-Z]\w+$"</code></pre>
<p>Here, with the validation regex, we can attest that we'll get a valid Java class file starting with a capitalized letter.</p>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>In a few instants, we created our worker template, and we have a nice base we can later grow if we need any new more complex worker.</p>
<p><em>Now, how do you create a worker with this template?</em></p>
<p>The easiest way is by simply running the following command from inside the folder in which you want the files to be created.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">$ kickstart /path/to/my/template</code></pre>
<p>This will parse the <code>template.toml</code> inside the given template path and,
for each <code>[[variable]]</code> block, will ask the prompt, validate the input,
and repeat until it's rightly entered.</p>
<p>Once all prompts have been resolved, it'll copy and parse the files into the current directory.</p>
<p><em>But I don't want to have all my templates in local, or pass the path every time!</em></p>
<p>Sure, having everything in local can be bothersome,
especially if you're starting a project from a huge project template.</p>
<p>To answer that, in the current version, kickstart supports cloning from a git remote by either HTTP(S), SSH or even git shortcuts!</p>
<p>In that sense, all the following commands are perfectly valid and will clone from a git remote.</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">$ kickstart git@gitlab.com:MyUser/MyTemplate
$ kickstart https://git.local/test
# With git shortcuts in the configuration, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/25975967/10165294
$ kickstart gl:MyUser/MyTemplate</code></pre>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>While still young, this tool is already, as-is, really useful and can handle a lot of situations.</p>
<p>Since the goal of this tool is to be as lightweight and basic as possible, you can have a fair
guarantee that it won't become an over-complex, feature-bloated, tool.</p>
<p>Not every feature has been showcased in this article, so I can only recommend you to go to the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/kickstart">official Github repository</a>,
and take a look at the <code>README.md</code> file, which should contains every information you'd need to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>As I publish this article, the official <code>v0.1.7</code> version have been released, and you can find the relesae on the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/kickstart/releases">releases page</a>.
If you'd prefer to be on the latest version, you can simply clone the repository, and, while inside it, run <code>cargo builld</code> and have a working version just for you.</p></p>

<hr><h3 class="post"><a href="https://www.junglecoder.com/blog/" title="Jungle Coder">Andrew Owen (yumaikas)</a></h3>


<h4><a href="https://www.junglecoder.com/blog/factorlang-review">Factor: An impressive stack-based language environment</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Recently the <a href="https://factorcode.org">Factor</a> programming language had a new 0.98 release, after a 4 year hiatus after the 0.97 release. Finding this on lobsters, I decided to take Factor for a spin again, after years of having left it mostly alone to work on PISC. I decided I wanted to try to build a (still slightly buggy) <a href="https://gist.github.com/yumaikas/6c8aebf8b0baf20431e06bd20c47dec4">4-function calculator</a>, as I find that a good way to gauge how easy/hard it is to use a GUI system for small things, and as a way to gauge what Factor is like in general.</p>

<h3>The (quite frankly) awesome</h3>

<p>Probably by <em>far</em> the most impressive part of Factor that I&rsquo;ve seen so far: Factor is the second language I&rsquo;ve come across that I&rsquo;d comfortably take on a deserted island without an internet connection (the other being Go with it&rsquo;s godoc server). This is due to the fact that a) 95% of all Factor documentation I&rsquo;ve seen is accessible from the included Help browser, and b) the Factor debugger/inspector can inspect itself in great detail. This is the cherry atop Factor: You don&rsquo;t just get a REPL, you also get a <em>really</em> useful set of debugging tools (especially the object inspector), and can dig into any of the state in the system, and using the help tools, once you understand some basics, you stand a decent chance of being able to either correct the state, or diagnose the bug.</p>

<p>This sort of tooling is something that SmallTalk is famous for, but any time I&rsquo;ve tried SmallTalk, I&rsquo;ve usually bounced off of it because most SmallTalk implementations end up living in their own world, making it hard to bring some of my favorite programming tools with me, and making it hard to interact with the outside world (footnote 3). Factor, on the other hand, even though it has an image that can updated to keep state around, and has a really good debugger, still integrates well with the outside world.</p>

<p>Really well, in fact. It&rsquo;s easy to scaffold a vocabulary <code>USE: tools.scaffold &quot;vocabulary-name&quot; scaffold-vocabulary</code> , and then run <code>USE: editors.sublime</code> (or emacs, or vim, or any of about 24 other fairly popular editors), and then run <code>&quot;vocabulary-name&quot; edit</code> and have it open the vocabulary in the editor in question. This allows you to open up any of the Factor source code in the editor of your choice. And when you&rsquo;re ready to start using/testing the vocabulary, running <code>&quot;vocabulary-name&quot; reload</code> puts you right into compile-fixing mode, where you can fix the bug in question, and then reload the vocabulary. When I was working on a 4-function calculator using the Factor listener and Sublime Text, it was a <em>really</em> tight feedback loop.</p>

<p>The GUI framework has a pretty nifty sorta-FRP like approach to how to handles data binding in controls, allowing you to daisy chain models (data that can be updated over time) via arrows (models with a quotation they apply to a base model when it&rsquo;s data changes).</p>

<p>Also, Factor has a mostly working dark-mode setup (there are some sections of the inspector that have poor contrast, but the listener is in a good state), if you dislike the default black-on-white color scheme (I found it difficult for some of the late night hacking I was doing). Run the following commands in the listener (assuming Factor 0.98)</p>

<pre><code>USE: tools.scaffold 
scaffold-factor-boot-rc
</code></pre>

<p>Then edit the .factor-boot-rc to look like so:</p>

<pre><code>USE: ui.theme.switching 

dark-mode
</code></pre>

<p>Then then run <code>run-bootstrap-init save</code> in the listener, and close and re-open the listener. Viola, Factor&rsquo;s dark mode!</p>

<h3>Consequences of (relative) obscurity</h3>

<p>That being said, there are still a few rough edges with Factor. For one, even though most things are documented, and those that are not have easily accessible source, Factor itself has almost no Google presence, which means that you have to be comfortable digging though the included help docs a bit longer to sort things out. This played out in a few practical ways when I was working on the 4-function calculator. Until the end of the project, I missed that <code>gadgets</code> (Factor&rsquo;s equivalent for controls in WinForms) were subclasses of <code>rectangles</code>, which meant that I could set their width and height by storing to the <code>dim</code>(ension) on a gadget:</p>

<pre><code class="factor">&quot;Test&quot; &lt;label&gt; { 200 300 } &gt;&gt;dim &quot;example of a 200x300 label&quot; open-window 
</code></pre>

<p>I ended up looking around the documentation about 4 times before I made that connection. This is the sort of question that would be on stack overflow for a more popular language.</p>

<p>For another, I seemed to be running across rendering or state glitches in the listener that could cause buttons to be mislabeled. I&rsquo;m unsure what was leading to it, but it was distracting, to say the least. The other thing with Factor that became evident was the singled threaded nature of it&rsquo;s runtime (as of currently). When first making a search in the help system, it would lock up, sometimes as long as 10-15 seconds, as it was indexing or loading in the various articles and such into memory. This limitation has kept me from digging into some languages (like Ocaml, though there are a bunch of other reasons, like iffy Windows support) in the past, especially when alternatives like Go and Erlang with their strong multi-threaded runtimes exist, but I think I&rsquo;m willing to look past it in Factor for now, especially since I hear that there is a half decent IPC story for Factor processes.</p>

<p>The other consequence of all this was that it took me roughly 10-15 hours of noodling around with Factor, and writing an even smaller example GUI script to be able to get the linked calculator above done. I think I could build other new things with far less stumbling around, but it was a good reminder of how slow learning something new can be.</p>

<p>The other minor frustration I have with Factor is the fact that any file that does much work tends to accrete quite a few imports in its <code>USING:</code> line (the calculator I wrote has 23 imports across 4 lines, even though it&rsquo;s only 100 lines of code). This is mostly due to a lot of various Factor systems being split into quite a few vocabularies. I could see this being helpful with compilation</p>

<h3>Comparisons to PISC</h3>

<p>Factor was a big inspiration for <a href="https://pisc.junglecoder.com/">Position Independent Source Code</a> (PISC), especially since it gave me the idea of code quotations some basic ideas for a few stack shuffling operations and some combinators (like <code>when</code> or <code>bi</code>). Factor and PISC have diverged a decent amount, though Factor is far and away further down the general path I&rsquo;d been wanting to take PISC in terms of documentation and interactivity. Revisiting it after spending 3 years of assorted free time working with PISC demonstrated that in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>Factor has a much higher level of introspection. When making the calculator I only had to think in Factor, rather than thinking in both PISC and Go (which is common when writing PISC). I also didn&rsquo;t have to rebuild many building blocks to get where I was going, like I would in PISC, as Slava and the other maintainers have done a <em>lot</em> of the foundational work already. Revisiting Factor after having written so much PISC did make understanding the stack a lot easier. I imagine that stack management will be most people&rsquo;s struggle with Factor. I&rsquo;ve found that implementing a stack language helped me there, but for some people, they may just have to do some exercises with it.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>I do anticipate building more side-projects in Factor, as I&rsquo;ve yet to try out the web framework, and I have a couple of ideas for websites in the back of my mind. There&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> of vocabularies that come with the base Factor download. I get the feeling that I may be adding some to it in the future, though time will tell.</p></p>

<h4><a href="https://sgoel.org/posts/nim-first-impressions/">Nim: First impressions</a></h4>
<p>
<p>As someone who writes software for a living, I think it's a good idea to learn a
new language/technology every once in a while. It makes you think differently
from what you've been focusing on in your normal 9-to-5.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I started playing around with <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> last weekend. Nim is a neat
little language that has been around for a bit more than 10 years, but has been
(surprisingly) under the radar, at least if you compare it to how much publicity
Go and Rust generate.</p>
<p>The promise looks quite nice - high performance, (optional) garbage collection,
dependency-free binaries, compilation to JavaScript (!), and a clean syntax that
at times reminds me of Python.</p>
<p>After working through the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut1.html">official tutorial</a> and <a href="https://nim-by-example.github.io/getting_started/">Nim by Example</a> over the
weekend, I've come to really like the language. There are some quirks that I
wish weren't there, but I'll try to summarize my first impressions in the
following sections.</p>
<h3>The Compiler</h3>
<p>If you're used to writing code in an interpreted language, "fighting the
compiler" can be a thing.</p>
<p>But I'm pleased to report that the Nim compiler, while pedantic like all others,
is actually quite helpful. The error messages are (for the most part) concise
and tell you exactly what you should do to turn your code into a binary.
And it's always nice to catch possible runtime errors at compile time.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following snippet that asks the user to enter a
number.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">strutils</span>

<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;What's your number? &quot;</span>

<span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">strutils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parseInt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">readLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stdin</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="n">case</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">of</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;One&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">of</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Two&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This fails to compile with the error message <code>not all cases are covered</code>, which
means that the compiler noticed that your <code>case</code> statement is not checking all
the possible cases and that this may cause unexpected behavior at runtime.</p>
<h3>Simple, but not really</h3>
<p>Nim looks small and simple on the surface, but it's a fairly advanced language.
There are features that let you do extremely funky things. You probably won't
end up using those features in daily use (well, depending on what you're using
it for), but you know that they are there.</p>
<p>I would argue that this is nice because the language feels approachable. It
feels like you can hold the entire language in your head (even though that may
not be the case). I don't feel the urge to hide in a corner on seeing Nim code
as a beginner to the language. At the same time you know it in the back of your
head that when you need to do advanced things, you can.</p>
<h3>Dependency-free binaries</h3>
<p>Coming from a Python world, this is <strong>huge</strong>. The <strong>simplest</strong> Python
deployments can still be fairly tricky to get right. There's the whole dance of
<code>virtualenv</code>s, installing dependencies, n-number of decisions you need to take
before even starting. And god help you if you need to install something that's
not pure Python.</p>
<p>Nothing is simpler than compiling the project and putting <strong>one binary</strong> on the
server and seeing things work.</p>
<h3>Compile-time constants</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>const value = doSomethingExpensive()
</pre></div>


<p><code>value</code> is set here at <strong>compile-time</strong>. Of course, if <code>doSomethingExpensive</code>
cannot be worked out at compile-time, the compiler will shout at you. But when
you're looking to reduce every single bit of runtime overhead, this is extremely
valuable.</p>
<h3>Productivity</h3>
<p>It was fascinating to observe that after spending effectively only a few hours
with the language, I felt like I was in a position to write <strong>working</strong> code.
I've had multiple moments writing Nim code when you write something and then
look at it and then go "was that it?".</p>
<p>The last time something like this happened was when I started learning Python.
It was astonishing that a programming language could put you in a position where
you can write <strong>working</strong> code so quickly.</p>
<h3>Variable assignment</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var x, y = 3
</pre></div>


<p>This sets the value of both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to be <code>3</code>, which seems slightly
confusing. Go does not compile something similar, complaining that there are 2
variables but 1 value.</p>
<p>To be honest, this is not a huge deal, but I can definitely see myself debugging
bugs caused by this behavior.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>From <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut2.html#object-oriented-programming-methods">methods</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding a method to a class the programmer has no control over is impossible
or needs ugly workarounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is mentioned under the section "disadvantages". I don't think this is a
disadvantage. I would actually argue that this keeps the programmer from doing
funky things that harm readability.</p>
<p>I once spent 2 days trying to debug an issue in a Ruby on Rails codebase where a
third-party gem was monkey-patching some functions defined in <code>ActiveRecord</code>.
This was a classic example of modifying something you're not supposed to modify.</p>
<h3>Module import semantics</h3>
<p>So far this has been my biggest complaint with Nim.</p>
<p>Consider this simple program.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">strutils</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>

<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="n">strutils</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The last three lines are all doing the same thing. So not only is the <code>split()</code>
function suddenly available on strings, but is also (optionally) a part of the
local namespace. It's difficult to say if <code>split</code> is a part of <code>strutils</code> or a
built-in function or a function defined on <code>string</code> types (if you didn't notice
the <code>import strutils</code>).</p>
<p>After writing Python code for slightly more than 10 years, I have "explicit is
better than implicit" plastered all over my brain. So such behavior makes me a
little uneasy.</p>
<p>From what I understand, this is a consequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax">Uniform Function Call
Syntax</a>, but IMHO this feels like a step back in terms of being able to look at
a piece of code and immediately make sense out of it.</p>
<p>But the Nim developers know this complaint. There's already a <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/8013">Github issue</a>,
and the <a href="https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/3783">forum thread</a> even has a proposal that might be implemented in one of
the next releases. So I'm hopeful!</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, I like Nim. If it's not painfully obvious, this article barely
scratched the surface. There is so much more to the language that I haven't
written about here for the sake of keeping this article short.</p>
<p>There are some design-things which I either don't get or don't agree with. But
on the other hand it provides many nice features without necessarily
compromising on speed or introducing complexity. My first attempt at picking up
one of the new systems-programming languages was at Rust, but it introduced so
much complexity that it was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Nim feels approachable, and gives you the feeling that it's powerful for when
you need something more than just simple.</p>
<p>Given that I've spent less than a week working with it and still like it so
much, I can definitely see myself writing more Nim code in the future.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/08/13/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/">Algorithmically Fingering Guitar Chords with Elixir</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Last time we wrote about using Elixir to generate all possible voicings of a given guitar chord <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">to find the voicing with the best voice leading between another chord</a>.</p>

<p>While this was great, there were several issues. We were conflating the idea of “musical distance” and “physical distance” when calculating optimal voice leading, and we weren’t taking the playability of the progressions we were generating into account.</p>

<p>To address both of these issues, we need to know not only <em>which</em> voicings are possible for a given chord, but also <em>how</em> each of those voicings can be played. We need to generate all possible fingerings for a given guitar chord voicing.</p>

<p>This sounds like a fantastic excuse to flex our Elixir muscles!</p>

<h2 id="calculating-fingerings">Calculating Fingerings</h2>

<p>We’ll start our journey into calculating all possible fingerings for a given guitar chord by creating a new Elixir module, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Fingering</span></code>, and a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord.Fingering do
  def fingerings(chord)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Our high level plan of attack for computing possible fingerings is fairly straight forward. Given that each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir#rendering-chords">a six-element array of frets being played</a>, like <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">]</span></code>, we want to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Attach all possible fingerings that can be played on each fret.</li>
  <li>Choose each possible finger in turn, sieve out all subsequent impossible fingers, and recursively repeat to get all possible fingerings.</li>
  <li>Perform any necessary cleanup.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our final <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function makes these steps fairly explicit:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def fingerings(chord),
  do:
    chord
    |&gt; attach_possible_fingers()
    |&gt; choose_and_sieve()
    |&gt; cleanup()
</code></pre>

<h2 id="possible-fingers-sieves">Possible Fingers? Sieves?</h2>

<p>Before we dive deeper into our solution, we should take a detour and talk about how we’re computing fingerings.</p>

<p>Our solution takes inspiration from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">“Sieve of Eratosthenes”</a>, which is a clever technique for calculating prime numbers. The basic idea of a “sieve” is that a choice made <em>now</em> can be used to filter out <em>future</em> unwanted results.</p>

<p>To bring it back to our situation, imagine we’re trying to play a D minor chord on the fifth fret:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/Dm.png" />
  <p>Our D minor chord.</p>
</div>

<p>If we were to start fingering this chord by placing our second finger on the low D note, we know that we couldn’t use our first finger on any of the other notes in the chord. Our first finger would have to wrap over or sneak under our second finger to reach those notes, and that’s essentially impossible:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/sieve.png" />
  <p>We can't use our first finger anywhere!</p>
</div>

<p>So by choosing to use our second finger on the fifth string and fret, we can sieve out the possibility of using our first finger on any of the remaining notes.</p>

<p>If we think about it, we can also sieve out the possibility of re-using our second finger. A finger can’t be re-used unless it’s forming a bar or a double-stop on an adjacent fret.</p>

<p>Our remaining set of possible fingers for the remaining notes are fingers three and four.</p>

<p>By recursively picking another of our possible fingers on another string and applying our sieving rules, we can come up with our entire set of possible fingers.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-and-sieving">Choosing and Sieving</h2>

<p>The meat of our algorithm lives in the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function, which takes an initial <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, complete with “possible fingers”, and a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> argument that defaults to an empty list:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve(chord, fingerings \\ [])
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> argument will be used to hold each finger choice for our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, as we choose them.</p>

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function expects each element of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> to be a two-element tuple, where the first element is the fret being played, and the second element is the set of possible fingers that could be chosen to play that fret.</p>

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">attach_possible_fingers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper function transforms our initial chord into that expected structure:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp attach_possible_fingers(chord),
  do: Enum.map(chord, &amp;{&amp;1, 1..4})
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Our implementation of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> is recursive, so we should start our implementation by defining our base case. The base case for <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> is triggered when <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is empty. At that point, we’ve handled every note in the chord, and need to return our fully constructed fingering:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([], fingerings),
  do:
    fingerings
    |&gt; Enum.reverse()
    |&gt; List.to_tuple()
</code></pre>

<p>As we’ll soon see, chosen fingers are appended onto <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> in reverse order, so we <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">reverse</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> our list to reorient our strings. Lastly we turn our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> list into a tuple so that we can safely <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">flatten</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> our resulting list of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> without losing our groupings.</p>

<p>Once flattened, our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">cleanup</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function maps over this final list and converts each tuple back into an array:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp cleanup(fingerings),
  do: Enum.map(fingerings, &amp;Tuple.to_list/1)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Moving on from our base case, it’s time to start thinking of other simple to handle situations.</p>

<p>If the next element in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> list is an unplayed string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>), we add it to our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> list and designate it to be played with no finger (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>), and recursively call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> on our remaining <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([{nil, _possible_fingers} | chord], fingerings),
  do: choose_and_sieve(chord, [{nil, nil} | fingerings])
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, if the next element of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is an open string, we’re recursively call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>, passing in our remaining <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, and our set of fingers appended with the open string played with no finger (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>):</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([{0, _possible_fingers} | chord], fingerings),
  do: choose_and_sieve(chord, [{0, nil} | fingerings])
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>In the case of actually needing to finger a note, the situation becomes more complicated. In that case, the next element of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is a fret and some set of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sieve_chord</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function maps over each of the notes in what’s left of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, and updates the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code> tuple element to sieve any fingerings that are now deemed impossible to play after placing our most recent finger:</p>

      {fret, sieve_fingers(possible_fingers, fret, fingerings)}
    end)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sieve_fingers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> helper function is where we make real decisions about the behavior of our fingering algorithm. The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sieve_fingers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> function itself is fairly straight forward. It simply rejects and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code> that are considered “bad” by our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">bad_finger?</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> helper function:</p>

defp sieve_fingers(possible_fingers, fret, fingerings),
  do: Enum.reject(possible_fingers, &amp;bad_finger?(fret, &amp;1, fingerings))
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">bad_finger?</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> function runs each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">finger</span></code>/<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fret</span></code> combinations through four rules used by our algorithm to determine if a finger choice is “impossible”, and should be culled from our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code> set:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp bad_finger?(fret, finger, fingerings),

      fret_below_finger_above?(fret, finger, fingerings),
      same_finger?(fret, finger, fingerings),
      impossible_bar?(fret, finger, fingerings)
    ])
</code></pre>

<p>If any of those rules are violated, the finger is rejected.</p>

<p>The first two rules check if a possible finger would need to stretch over or under an already placed finger, respectively:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp fret_above_finger_below?(fret, finger, [{new_fret, new_finger} | _]),
  do: fret &gt; new_fret &amp;&amp; finger &lt; new_finger

defp fret_below_finger_above?(fret, finger, [{new_fret, new_finger} | _]),
  do: fret &lt; new_fret &amp;&amp; finger &gt; new_finger
</code></pre>

<p>The third rule verifies that no finger can be used twice, unless when performing a bar or double-stop over adjacent frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp same_finger?(fret, finger, [{new_fret, new_finger} | _]),
  do: finger == new_finger &amp;&amp; fret != new_fret
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we need to prevent “impossible bars”, or bars that would mute notes played on lower frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp impossible_bar?(_fret, finger, fingerings = [{new_fret, _} | _]),
  do:
    fingerings
    |&gt; Enum.filter(fn {fret, _finger} -&gt; fret &gt; new_fret end)
    |&gt; Enum.map(fn {_fret, finger} -&gt; finger end)
    |&gt; Enum.member?(finger)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve implemented our fingering algorithm, let’s try a few examples.</p>

<p>We’ll start by calculating the possible fingerings for the D minor chord we’ve been using as an example. Fingering suggestions are listed below each string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[nil, 5, 7, 7, 6, nil]
|&gt; Chord.Fingering.fingerings()
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;Chord.Renderer.to_string/1)
|&gt; Enum.join("\n\n")
|&gt; IO.puts
</code></pre>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/Dm-voicings.png" />
  <p>Fingerings for our D minor chord.</p>
</div>

<p>Awesome! The first suggested bar can be difficult to play, but with some practice doing <a href="http://forums.tedgreene.com/post/how-to-do-a-a-ted-greene-double-stop-8526262">Ted Greene-style double-stops</a>, it’s manageable. The second and third suggestions are what I would normally reach for.</p>

<p>Another interesting example is an open G major shape:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3]
|&gt; Chord.Fingering.fingerings()
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;Chord.Renderer.to_string/1)
|&gt; Enum.join("\n\n")
|&gt; IO.puts
</code></pre>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/G-voicings.png" />
  <p>Fingerings for our G chord.</p>
</div>

<p>The first few fingering suggestions make sense, but as we get closer to the end of the list, some of the suggestions are increasingly difficult to play. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to play this fingering:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/G-bad-voicing.png" />
  <p>An "impossible" to play fingering.</p>
</div>

<p>As a human, I can explain to you why this is difficult to play, but I haven’t been able to come up with a general rule to add to our rule set that would prevent these kinds of fingerings from being suggested. At this point, I’d rather have the algorithm present <em>potentially impossible</em> fingerings, than have it over-aggressively prune <em>possible</em> fingerings from the result set.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>In my previous article on <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">“Voice Leading with Elixir”</a>, I mentioned that I was conflating the ideas of “musical distance” and “physical distance”. In terms of voice leading, all I really care about is optimizing a chord progression for musical distance. But as a guitar player, I also want to consider “physical distance”.</p>

<p>If a set of chords all have the same “musical distance” from a given starting chord, I want to choose the chord that has the lowest “physical distance”. By “physical distance”, I mean literally fret distance, but also how difficult it is to transition from one chord to another. Do I just need to slide one finger? That’s easy! Do I need to lift and replace three fingers while sliding the fourth? That’s not so easy…</p>

<p>We can’t calculate the “physical distance” between chords unless we know the fingerings for the chords in question. Now that we know the potential fingerings for a given chord, we can compute a (modified) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">levenshtein distance</a> between the fingerings of two chords!</p>

<p>Why is that cool?</p>

<p>Once that’s done, we’ll be able to take a starting chord (optionally with a starting fingering), and find the best voicing of the landing chord in terms of voice leading and ease of playability!</p>

<p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord/">the entire project on Github</a>, and stay tuned for more.</p></p>

<hr><h3 class="post"><a href="https://vfoley.xyz/" title="Occasionally sane">Vincent (vfoley)</a></h3>


<h4><a href="https://vfoley.xyz/rust-compile-speed-tips/">How to alleviate the pain of Rust compile times</a></h4>
<p>
<p>A few days ago, I wrote about two <a href="https://vfoley.xyz/rust-at-work/">Rust pain points</a> when using Rust at work.  One of these points were the long compile times.  In this post, I want to share a few tips that can help alleviate that pain.</p>

<h2 id="use-cargo-check">Use <code>cargo check</code></h2>

<p>We typically use the compiler for two reasons: to verify if the syntax and/or types are correct and to generate a runnable program.  When compiling a program, especially a release build, the majority of the time is spent generating LLVM bytecode and optimizing that bytecode.  If you only want to know whether your 3-line change typechecks, you don&rsquo;t want to wait for the optimizer.</p>

<p>For this reason, Cargo has a subcommand called <code>check</code> that only invokes the front-end.  It completes faster than a debug build and much faster than a release build.</p>

<p>As an example, here are the timing results of <code>cargo check</code> and <code>cargo build</code> for my personal project, ppbert.  (The benchmarks are performed by <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/">hyperfine</a>.)</p>

<pre><code>Benchmark #1: cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo check

  Time (mean ± σ):      8.131 s ±  0.424 s    [User: 24.234 s, System: 1.245 s]

  Range (min … max):    7.529 s …  8.845 s

Benchmark #2: cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build

  Time (mean ± σ):     16.904 s ±  0.794 s    [User: 52.009 s, System: 2.240 s]

  Range (min … max):   15.728 s … 18.098 s

Benchmark #3: cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release

  Time (mean ± σ):     48.454 s ±  2.540 s    [User: 145.644 s, System: 3.205 s]

  Range (min … max):   46.229 s … 54.107 s

Summary

  'cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo check' ran
    2.08x faster than 'cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build'
    5.96x faster than 'cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release'
</code></pre>

<p>From a clean slate, <code>cargo check</code> is 2x faster than <code>cargo build</code> and 6x faster than <code>cargo build --release</code>.  During development, when you just want to check that what you wrote is correct, definitely reach for <code>cargo check</code>.</p>

<h2 id="use-sccache">Use <code>sccache</code></h2>

<p>A co-worker introduced me to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sccache/"><code>sccache</code></a>, a compilation caching service by Mozilla that is compatible with Rust.  It will cache the build artifacts that Cargo generates, so if you <code>cargo clean</code> your project or go to work on a second project that shares dependencies with the first one, you won&rsquo;t have to rebuild everything.</p>

<p>You can install <code>sccache</code> with Cargo: <code>cargo install sccache</code>.  To activate <code>sccache</code>, add the following line to your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache
</code></pre>

<p>And here are the time differences.</p>

<pre><code>Benchmark #1: cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build

  Time (mean ± σ):     15.726 s ±  0.330 s    [User: 50.183 s, System: 2.210 s]

  Range (min … max):   15.148 s … 16.210 s

Benchmark #2: cargo clean &amp;&amp; RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache cargo build

  Time (mean ± σ):      6.877 s ±  4.665 s    [User: 6.964 s, System: 0.916 s]

  Range (min … max):    5.135 s … 20.136 s

  Warning: The first benchmarking run for this command was
  significantly slower than the rest (20.136 s). This could be caused
  by (filesystem) caches that were not filled until after the first
  run. You should consider using the '--warmup' option to fill those
  caches before the actual benchmark. Alternatively, use the
  '--prepare' option to clear the caches before each timing run.

Summary

  'cargo clean &amp;&amp; RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache cargo build' ran
    2.29x faster than 'cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build'
</code></pre>

<p>Given the ease of installing and configuring <code>sccache</code>, I see no reason not to use it and get that 2x speed boost.  One downside of <code>sccache</code>: it won&rsquo;t make your continuous integration builds faster.  (You could configure <code>sccache</code> to use an S3 bucket, but I prefer to have completely clean builds from my CI.)</p>

<h2 id="avoid-lto">Avoid LTO</h2>

<p>LTO is the acronym for link-time optimization.  Compilers build and optimize compilation units individually.  LTO is a mechanism for taking those individually-optimized object files and finding more opportunities for optimization when they are considered as a group.  This is great if you want to have the fastest possible program, but the price you pay are higher compilation times.  In Rust, the compilation unit is the crate; if the heavy computations are all done in your crate, then maybe LTO isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>

<p>Here is the difference in execution time of ppbert with and without LTO on a 100 MiB .bert2 file.</p>

<pre><code>Benchmark #1: /tmp/ppbert-without-lto -2 /tmp/100m.bert2

  Time (mean ± σ):      1.926 s ±  0.005 s    [User: 1.308 s, System: 0.618 s]

  Range (min … max):    1.921 s …  1.937 s

Benchmark #2: /tmp/ppbert-with-lto -2 /tmp/100m.bert2

  Time (mean ± σ):      1.887 s ±  0.012 s    [User: 1.273 s, System: 0.613 s]

  Range (min … max):    1.867 s …  1.905 s

Summary

  '/tmp/ppbert-with-lto -2 /tmp/100m.bert2' ran
    1.02x faster than '/tmp/ppbert-without-lto -2 /tmp/100m.bert2'
</code></pre>

<p>There is a slight difference (which is why I enable LTO), but let&rsquo;s look at what LTO does to compile times (with sccache enabled):</p>

<pre><code>Benchmark #1: sed -i &quot;s/lto.*/lto=false/&quot; Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release

  Time (mean ± σ):      5.793 s ±  0.075 s    [User: 11.390 s, System: 0.767 s]

  Range (min … max):    5.693 s …  5.901 s

Benchmark #2: sed -i &quot;s/lto.*/lto=true/&quot; Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release

  Time (mean ± σ):     18.483 s ±  0.321 s    [User: 34.288 s, System: 1.182 s]

  Range (min … max):   17.971 s … 18.893 s

Summary

  'sed -i &quot;s/lto.*/lto=false/&quot; Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release' ran
    3.19x faster than 'sed -i &quot;s/lto.*/lto=true/&quot; Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release'
</code></pre>

<p>LTO makes the compilation of ppbert 300% longer for a 2% speed gain at run-time.  If you have a project that you find too long to build, I encourage you to measure the compile times with and without LTO, and the execution speed with and without LTO.  Maybe you&rsquo;ll find (like I did in a project at work) that you don&rsquo;t want to enable LTO.</p>

<h2 id="control-your-dependencies">Control your dependencies</h2>

<p>Rust has a rich ecosystem, and every day we have access to more quality crates.  This is mostly a blessing, but more crates mean more compilation, and this has a negative effect on your compile times.  Now, don&rsquo;t shun all dependencies and write everything yourself!  Rather, make sure that the crates your bring in pay for themselves.</p>

<p>One thing that you can do to control dependencies is to examine your depdendencies and see if they have features that you can disable.  For instance, in ppbert I use <a href="https://clap.rs">clap</a> to parse command-line arguments; by default, clap colors its output and offers suggestions when the user makes a spelling mistake.  Some people like these features, but I&rsquo;m not a fan myself.  Fortuately, the authors of clap have made such features optional.  So I am able to deactivate what I don&rsquo;t need, and not pay the compilation price for it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the dependency tree of clap with default-features enabled, and without.</p>

<pre><code>$ rg default-features Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo tree -p clap
33:default-features=true
clap v2.31.2
├── ansi_term v0.11.0
├── atty v0.2.11
│   └── libc v0.2.42
├── bitflags v1.0.3
├── strsim v0.7.0
├── textwrap v0.9.0
│   └── unicode-width v0.1.5
├── unicode-width v0.1.5 (*)
└── vec_map v0.8.1

$ vi Cargo.toml

$ rg default-features Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo tree -p clap
33:default-features=false
clap v2.31.2
├── bitflags v1.0.3
├── textwrap v0.9.0
│   └── unicode-width v0.1.5
└── unicode-width v0.1.5 (*)

</code></pre>

<p>So I only need to compile 4 external crates rather than 9.  Many crates make some of their dependencies optional; make sure you only bring in what you really need.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Rust doesn&rsquo;t have the fastest compiler in the world, and that creates friction when writing code.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to improvements on that front more than any other Rust feature.  Fortunately, in the mean time, there are ways to make Rust compile your projects a little faster.</p></p>

<h4><a href="https://sgoel.org/posts/switching-from-keepassxc-to-bitwarden/">Switching from KeePassXC to Bitwarden</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I have been looking to replace my password management setup for a few months
now. Up until now I was using <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>, but I never got around to putting in
the work to make it work properly on mobile.</p>
<p>I understand that the standard solution is to just get the file synced on your
phone using Dropbox and then install a mobile app which can read the file off of
Dropbox. But the idea that all my passwords are in one single file somewhere on
the internet (cloud, if you will) is a bit disturbing.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is also the reason I never got around to using <a href="https://1password.com/">1password</a>,
<a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">Lastpass</a>, or other cloud-hosted password managers.</p>
<p>This is not to discount the work that the security folks at these companies are
putting in on a daily basis to make their services secure. And I know that my
passwords file is encrypted. I've just seen enough mistakes happen and I'd like
to avoid being a part of one.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>My requirements were fairly simple. I wanted something that</p>
<ol>
<li>is open-source</li>
<li>allows self-hosting</li>
<li>works on mobile</li>
</ol>
<p>... in that order.</p>
<p>Turns out that just these 3 requirements narrowed down the search to
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>.</p>
<h3>Bitwarden</h3>
<p>Bitwarden is <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden">open source</a>. There's a <code>core</code> server written in C# and then there
are multiple client apps (iOS, Android, desktop).</p>
<p>The backend appears quite heavy weight. Being written in C# and talking to a SQL
server installation, it's not exactly what I would call "deployment friendly".
Luckily, they provide a <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/core#deploy">Docker image</a> which you can use to self-host the whole
thing.</p>
<p>While this works on a modern machine, I wanted to run Bitwarden on a spare
Raspberry Pi connected to my home network where the system requirements are a
bit less than what the Docker image requires.</p>
<p>It turns out that I'm not the first person to run into this problem. <a href="https://jcs.org">@jcs</a>
already <a href="https://jcs.org/2017/11/17/bitwarden">wrote</a> a <a href="https://github.com/jcs/rubywarden">Ruby server</a> which is API-compatible with the "official"
Bitwarden backend. This implementation is <strong>very</strong> lightweight, and completely
doable for the Pi. So all I had to do was create a new <code>bitwarden</code> user on the
Pi, install <code>rvm</code>, <code>git clone</code> the repository, and then start the server
process.</p>
<p>The only problem left now was setting up a static IP for the Pi so that the
desktop client on my laptop and the iOS app on my phone know the
(static &amp; private) IP address they should be connecting to. Luckily my modem
supported allocating the same IP to devices based on their MAC addresses so this
was also easy.</p>
<h3>Migrating from KeePassXC</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jcs/rubywarden">rubywarden</a> includes a script to import existing KeePassXC database files, and
it worked without any problems. The script somehow didn't handle my KeePassXC
folders very well. So an entry called "Google" in the "Internet" folder was
imported as "Internet/Google". Those slashes look pretty annoying, so I took
some time out to delete some unused passwords and organize the rest into
folders.</p>
<p>Migration was a non-issue, I would say.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>The only caveat with this system that I can think of right now is that when
you're not at home, you won't be able to save/edit/delete passwords. You'll be
able to read just fine, but editing won't work.</p>
<p>The reason is that your client apps are configured to talk to a private IP
address (of the Pi in this case). But so far I haven't had the need to
save/edit/delete passwords when I'm outside. And reading them works just fine.</p>
<p>If this is important for you, then this is probably the price you pay for
keeping the passwords on a machine you can physically look at.</p>
<p>But overall, I find this setup quite nice to work with.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">Voice Leading with Elixir</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I play quite a bit of guitar in my free time. Once of the things I’ve been practicing lately is improving my voice leading between chords.</p>

<p>Voice leading refers to how the individual notes, or voices, within a chord move when you transition to another chord. You often want as little movement as possible to keep the transition from sounding jarring (unless you’re going for jarring).</p>

<p>So for example, if I play a G7 way up the neck, I probably wouldn’t want to follow it with a Cmaj7 played towards the nut. Instead, I’d like to find another voicing of Cmaj7 that’s both physically and musically closer to our G7 chord.</p>

<p>Knowing how to voice lead between chords usually requires a vast knowledge of the fretboard, a huge chord vocabulary, and lots of practice. But who needs all then when you have a computer and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">the Elixir programming language</a>?</p>

<p>Let’s use Elixir to chug through all of the possible Cmaj7 chords and find those with the best voice leading from our G7!</p>

<h2 id="rendering-chords">Rendering Chords</h2>

<p>Before we start talking about recruiting our computer to help us find the best voice leading between chords, we should take a detour and talk about guitar chords and how we’ll work with them.</p>

<p>When you break it down to the basic, a “guitar” is just six strings attached to a piece of wood. A “chord” is just a set of notes played simultaneously across any number of those strings. Different notes can be played on each string by pressing on any “fret” along the neck.</p>



<p>Given those definitions, the simplest ways to represent a chord using Elixir data structures probably be as a six element list (or tuple).</p>

<p>Here’s our G7 chord represented as an array:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil]
</code></pre>

<p>From the thickest string to the thinnest, we’re not playing anything on the first string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>). We’re playing a G on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">10</span></code>), a D on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">12</span></code>), an F on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">10</span></code>), a B on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">12</span></code>), and nothing on the thinnest string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>).</p>

<p>To make our lives easier, we should come up with some way of displaying these chords in a more guitarist-friendly manner. One common option for displaying guitar chords is with <a href="http://www.tedgreene.com/images/lessons/students/PaulVachon/HowToReadTedGreeneChordDiagrams.pdf">chord charts</a>:</p>

<p>To kick things off, let’s write a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Renderer</span></code> module with a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function that takes a chord and returns a unicode-based chart for the provided chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord.Renderer do
  def to_string(chord, chord_name) do
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we’ll need to do is find out the “reach” of our chord. What’s the lowest fret used in the chord and the highest?</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{min, max} =
  chord
  |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
  |&gt; Enum.min_max()
</code></pre>

<p>We can use Elixir’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reject</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> to filter out unplayed strings and then use <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">min_max</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> to easily find both the lowest and highest fret used in the chord.</p>

<p>Next we’ll iterate over every set of frets within the range of the chord and render each row using a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">row_to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> helper function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
0..max(max - min, 3)
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;row_to_string(&amp;1, min, chord, chord_name))
</code></pre>

<p>Most fret charts render some minimum number of rows, even if the chord only takes up one fret of vertical space. We’ll iterate between <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code> and either <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">max</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">min</span></code>, or <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">3</span></code>, depending on which value is larger. This means we’ll always render at least four rows of frets for each diagram.</p>

<p>We’ll also want to intersperse the horizontal fret lines below each row of fingered notes on each row of frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.intersperse([:bright, :black, "\n   ├┼┼┼┼┤\n"])
</code></pre>

<p>We’re using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.ANSI.html">Elixir’s ANSI color codes</a> to color our fretboard lines a dark grey color, and building our final string as <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/elixir-and-io-lists-part-1-building-output-efficiently/">an IO list</a>, rather than a single concatenated string.</p>

<p>Because we’re using ANSI color codes, we need to format and convert our resulting nested list structure into a string before returning it from our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; IO.ANSI.format()
|&gt; IO.chardata_to_string()
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">row_to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> helper function is fairly straight forward. It simply renders a left gutter, the row of frets with any potential fingerings, and a right gutter:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp row_to_string(offset, base, chord, chord_name),
  do: [
    left_gutter(offset, base + offset),
    Enum.map(chord, &amp;fret_to_string(&amp;1, base + offset)),
    right_gutter(offset, chord_name)
  ]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">left_gutter</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function renders the lowest fret used in the chord on the first line of the chart:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp left_gutter(0, fret),
    do: [:bright, :yellow, String.pad_leading("#{fret}", 2, " ") &lt;&gt; " "]
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, we render a spacer:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp left_gutter(_, _),
  do: "   "
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">right_gutter</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function either renders an optional <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_name</span></code> on the first line of the chord chart:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp right_gutter(0, chord_name),
  do: [:yellow, " #{chord_name}"]
</code></pre>

<p>Or an empty string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp right_gutter(_, _),
  do: ""
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all there is to it!</p>

<p>Now we can render chords by passing them into <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Renderer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.Renderer.to_string([nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil], "G7")
|&gt; IO.puts
</code></pre>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">10 │●│●││ G7
   ├┼┼┼┼┤
   ││││││
   ├┼┼┼┼┤
   ││●│●│
   ├┼┼┼┼┤
   ││││││
</code></pre>

<p>And in its fully colored glory:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/voice-leading-with-elixir/G7.png" />
  <p>Our G7 chord, as rendered by our new module.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="chord-distance">Chord Distance</h2>

<p>We can roughly approximate how “good” the voice leading is between two chords by counting the number of frets each finger has to move when changing chords. We can call this the “distance” between the two chords. In the simplest terms, chords with good voice leading have minimal distance between each other.</p>

<p>If we can write a function that computes this distance between chords, we might be able to generate all possible Cmaj7 voicings, and find the voicing that leads best from our G7!</p>

<p>Let’s say that each fret moved on a single string equals one unit of “distance”, and adding or removing a note to or from a string also counts as a single unit of distance.</p>

<p>Using that heuristic, let’s write a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module and a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function that calculates the distance between two chords.</p>

<p>If both chords are equal, there is zero distance between them:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(chord, chord),
  do: 0
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the distance between two chords is the sum of the distance between their individual fretted notes on each string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance([fret_a | rest_a], [fret_b | rest_b]),
  do: distance(fret_a, fret_b) + distance(rest_a, rest_b)
</code></pre>

<p>If a the first chord doesn’t have a note fretted on a string, and the next chord does, we’ll add one unit of distance:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(nil, fret),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>And visa versa:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(fret, nil),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, if both strings have fretted notes, the distance moved on that string is the number of frets between the two chords on that string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(fret_a, fret_b),
  do: abs(fret_a - fret_b)
</code></pre>

<p>We can manually calculate the distance between our G7 chord (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">]</span></code>), and a few different Cmaj7 voicings we may know:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.distance([nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil], [nil, 3, 5, 4, 5, nil])   # 27
Chord.distance([nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil], [8, 10, 9, 9, nil, nil])  # 6
</code></pre>

<p>So according to our heuristic, the second voicing of Cmaj7 has much better voice leading between our G7 than the first voicing of Cmaj7.</p>

<p>This is great, but we’re still limited by our knowledge of the fretboard. What if we only know two voicings of a Cmaj7 chord. Is this the best we can do?</p>

<p>Absolutely not!</p>

<h2 id="brute-forced-voicings">Brute Forced Voicings</h2>

<p>The last piece of this puzzle is to write a function that will generate all possible voicings of a given chord across the neck of the guitar. If we have all of the possible voicings of our Cmaj7, for example, we can easily find the voicing that has the best voice leading from our G7 chord!</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def voicings(notes) do
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function accepts an array of numbers representing the notes we want in our chord. For example, if we wanted all of the voicings of our Cmaj7 chord, we’d call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">vocings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> with a C (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>), an E (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">4</span></code>), a G (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">7</span></code>), and a B (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">11</span></code>). These numbers correspond to the lowest set of <a href="http://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">MIDI notes</a>, ranging from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code> to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">11</span></code>.</p>

<p>The first thing we want to do is calculate all of the possible “note sets” that will be spread across our guitar strings:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
notes
|&gt; all_note_sets()
</code></pre>

<p>If a chord has fewer notes than the number of strings we want to play, some number of those notes will have to be repeated. To illustrate, imagine we want to play our four note Cmaj7 using all six strings of the guitar. We’ll obviously have four strings playing C, E, G, and B, but what will the other two strings play?</p>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">all_note_sets</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper functions calculates this list of all possible note sets using some hand-waving combinatorics, and a few unfortunate list comprehensions:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def all_note_sets(notes) do
  for length &lt;- 6..length(notes) do
    for base &lt;- Combination.combine(notes, min(length, length(notes))) do
      for extension &lt;- Combination.combine(notes, length - length(notes)) do
        base ++ extension
      end
    end
  end
  |&gt; Enum.reduce(&amp;Kernel.++/2)
  |&gt; Enum.reduce(&amp;Kernel.++/2)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Next, our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function needs to take each of these possible note sets and build all possible chords using that set of notes:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;build_chords/1)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">build_chords</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper works by recursively building up all possible chords made of all possible notes in the provided note sets.</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def build_chords(note_set, chord \\ [nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil], chords \\ [])
</code></pre>

<p>It starts by looking at the first note in the provided note set and finds all occurrences of that note across all of the strings of our guitar using the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">all_notes</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
note
|&gt; all_notes
</code></pre>

<p>Next, it filters out notes on strings already used in the current chord under construction:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.filter(fn {string, fret} -&gt; Enum.at(chord, string) == nil end)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, it takes each note, inserts it into the current chord, and checks the “stretch” of the chord. If the chord spans more than five frets, we deem it impossible to play and filter it out (which is obviously an over-simplification, especially at higher frets). Otherwise, we recursively call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">build_chords</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code>, passing in the newly updated current chord and the remaining set of notes in our note set:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(fn {string, fret} -&gt;
  new_chord = List.replace_at(chord, string, fret)

  {min, max} =
    new_chord
    |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
    |&gt; Enum.min_max(fn -&gt; {0, 0} end)

  if max - min &lt;= 5 do
    build_chords(rest, new_chord, chords)
  else
    chords
  end
end)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">all_notes</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper function works by accepting the abstract value of the note we’re looking for (C is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>), the optional <a href="http://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">MIDI notes</a> of the tuning of each string, and the optional number of frets up the neck we want to look for notes:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def all_notes(target_note, strings \\ [40, 45, 50, 55, 59, 64], frets \\ 12) do
end
</code></pre>

<p>It then constructs a two dimensional list of <a href="http://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">MIDI notes</a> up the neck and across the fretboard:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
fretboard =
  for fret &lt;- 0..frets,
    do: Enum.map(strings, &amp;(&amp;1 + fret))
</code></pre>

<p>Once we’ve built up our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fretboard</span></code>, we’ll filter out all of the notes that aren’t the specific note we’re looking for. We loop over every row of frets, and every string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
fretboard
|&gt; Enum.with_index()
|&gt; Enum.map(fn {row, index} -&gt;
  row
  |&gt; Enum.with_index()
  |&gt; Enum.map(fn {note, string} -&gt;
    ...
  end)
end)
</code></pre>

<p>For each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">note</span></code> we encounter, we check if <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">rem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">note</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">)</span></code> equals our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">target_note</span></code>. If it does, we replace the current note value with a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">string</span></code>/<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">index</span></code> tuple that can be used when building our guitar chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
if rem(note, 12) == target_note do
  {string, index}
else
  nil
end
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, we replace the current note with <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>.</p>

<p>Next, we flatten our multidimensional fretboard representation and filter out all of the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code> values, leaving us with just the set of notes we’re looking for, and where they can be found on the fretboard.</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>Let’s try it out by listing the first three voicings of a Cmaj7 chord our new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper finds:</p>

<p>Cool!</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all Together</h2>

<p>Now that our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper is finished, we can put all of the pieces together.</p>

<p>Let’s start by calculating all of the possible voicings of our Cmaj7 chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[0, 4, 7, 11]
|&gt; Chord.voicings()
</code></pre>

<p>Next, let’s map over each voicing and build a tuple who’s first element is the distance from our G7 chord, and who’s second element is the generated voicing itself:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;{Chord.distance(&amp;1, [nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil]), &amp;1})
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s sort that list. Because the distance from our G7 chord is the first element in each tuple, we’re effectively sorting by distance:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.sort()
</code></pre>

<p>Now the “best” options for Cmaj7 voicings should be at the top of our list. Let’s take the first three:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.take(3)
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll map each voicing through our chord chart renderer:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(fn {distance, chord} -&gt; Chord.to_string(chord, "Cmaj7") end)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, let’s join each of our three charts together with newlines and print the result:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.join("\n\n")
|&gt; IO.puts()
</code></pre>

  <p>Our generated Cmaj7 voicings.</p>
</div>

<p>Each of the voicings recommended by our software sound fairly nice. Much nicer than the first voicing we were using way down the neck. The third voicing definitely has an interesting flavor, and is something I never would have reached for without the help of this software, but I’m glad to know it’s there.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-and-future-work">Final Thoughts and Future Work</h2>

<p>I have many, many final thoughts about this project. If you can’t tell, I’m incredibly excited about this kind of thing.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on improving the “distance” heuristic, which raises many interesting questions about what exactly voice leading is, and who it’s for. Should I optimize for the player, or the listener? Thanks to how the guitar works, chords on wildly different sections of the neck may be very close musically, but my algorithm will filter these chords out as being “too far.” In many ways, I’m conflating “voice leading” between chords with “playability” between chords. Is this what I want?</p>

<p>I’m also working on optimizing the voice leading over entire chord progressions.  As you might guess, this is a much more expansive problem.</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/voice-leading-with-elixir/progression.png" />
  <p>A generated chord progression.</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, if you’re interested in this kind of thing, I highly recommend you check out Ted Greene’s guitar work. Ted is, in my opinion, one of the true masters of the guitar, and put some serious work into perfecting his voice leading skills.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.tedgreene.com/">Ted Greene archive</a>, the archive’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TedGreeneArchives">Youtube page</a>, and <strong>definitely check out two of Ted’s books: <a href="https://amzn.to/2uV6w1g">Chord Chemistry</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Chord-Progressions-Classical-Voicings/dp/0898986982/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1532731370&sr=1-1">Modern Chord Progressions</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve uploaded this entire project <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord">to Github</a>, if you’re curious the see the source in its entirety. Check it out!</p>

<p>Obviously, this kind of thing is just a tool, and the chord transitions and progressions generated by the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module are just suggestions and starting places, not fully-fleshed out music. That being said, these tools have already given me many new ideas and shown me many interesting chords I never would have reached for without having them shown to me.</p></p>

<h4><a href="https://sulami.github.io/How this blog is madeHow this blog is made">How this blog is made</a></h4>
<p>
<p>While this blog has always been powered by a static-page generator, a while ago I switched from using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, a Python-based generator, to <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, a Haskell-based one. There was no real practical reason for this, and objectively the switch has been a huge waste of time, though I have learned a lot about Haskell and am very happy with how this blog currently works.</p>
<p>The basic setup is quite simple, I am using <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> to manage build dependencies and sandboxing for Haskell<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is actually one of my basic requirements for new languages that I pick up. It is 2018, you can ship your language with a package manager that sandboxes by default. One of my biggest problems with Python is virtualenv.<br />
<br />
</span></span>. For reasons that become clear later in this post, I also need a LaTeX installation, which currently is not managed in any way, but I do not require anything out of the ordinary, so usually it is just a matter of install ing the distribution for my operating system.</p>
<h2 id="hakyll-hacks">Hakyll Hacks</h2>
<p>To achieve a nice, human-readable URL scheme I am not only generating a slug from the original file name, which usually matches the title, but to get rid of the ugly <code>.html</code> postfix I actually render all pages and posts to <code>index.html</code> files in directories with the corresponding name, resulting in URLs with trailing slashes. Credit for this goes to <a href="https://www.rohanjain.in/hakyll-clean-urls/">Rohan Jain</a>.</p>
<p>Of course this blog also has an Atom feed<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Atom vs. RSS has been <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/09/23/">debated for a while</a>, in the end my use case is super simple anyway, so I am just using Atom until I find an actually valid reason to get into comparing the two formats.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, so you can follow my posts in your favourite newsreader, or use Firefox live bookmarks for example. I ran into one particular problem with this though, as one of my recent posts included an ampersand (&amp;) in the title. The rendered feed file (no matter the format) would be invalid due to this. So I had to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">URL encoding</a> for titles myself (this is already done for the body by Hakyll). Thanks to the way Hakyll embraces the Haskell philosphy, this was just a matter of mapping the encoding function over the post titles for the feed output.</p>
<h2 id="symetric-html-pdf-output">Symetric HTML &amp; PDF output</h2>
<p>A long while ago I had the idea of making my CV available online in the browser, like many front end developers do to showcase their skills. At the same time I still need a PDF version that can be printed neatly. Being a developer, I of course cannot fathom the idea of having two sets of CVs, so I thought why not generate both versions from the same source (of truth), using one single build process. So that is what I am currently finalising.</p>
<p>The HTML version for the website is just a static page in the blog, simple enough. Hakyll gives me very fine-grained control over the actual build process, so I can leverage custom Markdown tags to control layout if I need to. The PDF version of my CV has always been generated using <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, because it generates beautifully rendered output in a reproducible fashion. Because I am using <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to generate HTML from the Markdown source, I am also using it to generate the LaTeX source code from the same source, and then just pass it into a LaTeX template. Then I just run <code>xetex</code> in a subprocess to render the final PDF.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>This blog is currently hosted in two locations, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> which I have been using for many years, and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/">GitLab pages</a>, which I only added recently. While the build and deployment process for these two platforms is slightly different, they mostly work off the same codebase, with the only difference being a <a href="https://github.com/sulami/sulami.github.io/blob/develop/Makefile">makefile for Github</a> being replaced by the <a href="https://gitlab.com/sulami/sulami.gitlab.io/blob/develop/.gitlab-ci.yml">GitLab-specific build file</a>. The Github version I generate locally with my locally compiled Hakyll, and then push the the right branch using the makefile. This makefile also allows me to run a local server to preview the rendered output before committing. The GitLab repository is setup to mirror the one on GitHub and rebuild via GitLab CI on every change, so it is compiling the Hakyll application in a Docker container and the generating the output.</p>
<p>These two build processes have different pros and cons. The GitHub version is available slightly faster, as my local render only takes a couple of seconds and after pushing I just have to wait for Github’s cache to refresh, which usually takes only a couple of minutes, while the GitLab version has to run the CI job which takes a couple of minutes. On the upside the GitLab version does not require me to have a locally installed version of Haskell, Stack or anything else, as long as I can push to the repository, allowing me to explore workflows which happen end-to-end on iOS. I have been investigating this exact workflow, using a combination of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737172">iA Writer</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334">Workflow</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807">Working Copy</a> to write, transform and push the posts, leaving the build process to GitLab CI.</p>
<p>If you are interested in details, have a look at the source on either <a href="https://github.com/sulami/sulami.github.io">Github</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/sulami/sulami.gitlab.io">GitLab</a>.</p></p>

<p>One thing I wanted to think about is, speaking as someone working in this field and interested in making changes in my day-to-day life, what kind of tools or ideas would be useful for me? What should I do?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Alongside this thought, another thought I had is that somehow the big lists of rules feel very impersonal and disconnected from my experiences. I also feel a little bit unsatisfied about opt-in rules. Here’s a few from the around the place, that I’ve seen:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
<a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/">Future of Life</a> (June 2018, relevant items)

6 - Safety: AI systems should be safe and secure throughout their operational lifetime, and verifably so where applicable and feasible
</div></li>
<li><div>
7 - Failure Transparency: If an AI system causes harm, it should be possible to ascertain why.
</div></li>
<li><div>
8 - Judical Transparency: Any involvement by an autonomous system in judicial decision-making should provide a satisfactory explanation auditable by a competent human authority.
</div></li>
<li><div>
9 - Responsibility: Designers and building of advanced AI systems are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications.
</div></li>
<li><div>
10 - Value Alignment: Highly autonomous AI systems should be designed so that their goals and behviours
</div></li>
<li><div>
11 - Human Values: AI Systems should be designed and operated so as to be compatible with ideals of human dignift, rights, freedoms, and cultural diversity.
</div></li>
<li><div>
12 - Personal Privacy: People should have the right to access, manage and control the data they generate, given AI systems’ power to analyze and utilize that data.
</div></li>
<li><div>
13 - Liberty and Privacy: The application of AI to personal data must not unreasonably curtail people’s real or perceived liberty.
</div></li>
<li><div>
14 - Shared Benefit: AI technologies should benefit and empower as many people as possible.
</div></li>
<li><div>
15 - Shared Prosperity: The economic prosperity created by AI should be shared broadly, to benefit all of humanity.
</div></li>
<li><div>
16 - Human Control: Humans should choose how and whether to delegate decisions to AI systems, to accomplish human chose objectives.
</div></li>
<li><div>
17 - Non-subversion: The power conferred by control of highly advanced AI systems should respect and improve, rather an subvert, the social and civic processes on which the health of society depends.
</div></li>
<li><div>
18 - AI Arms Race: An arms race in lethal autonomous weapons should be avoided.

<p>I have a few problems with these rules:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
It’s easy to imagine situations in which they are counter-productive,
</div></li>
<li><div>
I don’t feel a lot of ownership of them, as I wasn’t involved in their construction,
</div></li>
<li><div>
No-one is enforcing them on me,
</div></li>
<li><div>
They’re often highly impractical or contain colloquial/regional/policital concerns (“Boost French Research …”),
</div></li>
<li><div>
They’re also very overwhelming and demanding, how can I ensure that we do <em>all</em> of them?
</div></li>
<li><div>

</div></li>
<li><div>
It might help to lobby governments/organisations to get funding to make progress on certain aspects?
</div></li>
<li><div>

</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, what should any given engineer working in this area do? One thought I’ve had recently is a simple one: Let’s just aim at building empathy for the people that will be affected by our software.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is reasonably actionable, say, with local groups by organising meetings between technical people and the people that may be affected. I.e. in the medical-AI setting, let’s organise regular catch-ups between the engineers, the doctors, nursing staff, and hospital adminstration types, along with perhaps patient representatives.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the setting, of, say, law software, again we just set up regular events for the two groups to chat through issues, work together on small projects, and build a mutual understanding of difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I think this approach is a bit nicer than, say, creating a new set of rules that make sense for us locally, and then forcing people to follow them. One idea I like about the empathy-based/collaborative approach (or “human-centered design”; another term for this kind thing), is that it allos people to <em>adapt to local circumstances</em>, which I think is really crucial in allowing any one person to feel like they have some control over the application of any rules they come up with, and thus getting them to actually take an interest in enforcing them in their organisation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, my new rule of thumb for this ethics-related AI stuff will be: Can I meet with some of the people that will be affected? What are their thoughts? What problems are they working through and what are they interested in?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As always, I’m interested in your thoughts on the matter!</p>

<p>
<p>IPFS is a peer-to-peer protocol that allows you to access and publish content in a decentralized fashion. It uses hashes to refer to files. Short of someone posting hashes on a website, discoverability of content is pretty low. In this article, we’re going to write a very simple crawler for IPFS. It’s challenging to have a traditional search engine in IPFS because content rarely links to each other. But there is another way than just blindly following links like a traditional crawler.</p></p>

On top of being an simple example for genetic algorithms, it is also a fun programming project that can be done in short time. For this project, we are going to use the Hill Climbing algorithm. The algorithm for evolving pictures is like the following. Create two empty images, image 1 and image 2 Do a small random modification (like a line) to the first image If the first image is closer to the target than the first one, copy it to image 2 Otherwise, copy the second image to image 1 Goto 2 I will be using Rust for this project.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/23/building-a-better-receive-loop/">Building a Better Receive Loop</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I’ve been putting quite a bit of time this past week into overhauling and refactoring <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/bitcoin_network/">my in-progress Elixir-based Bitcoin node</a>.</p>

<p>As a part of that overhaul, I turned my attention to how we’re receiving packets from connected peers. The way we’ve been handling incoming packets is overly complicated and can be greatly simplified by taking advantage of the Bitcoin protocol’s packet structure.</p>

<p>Let’s go over our old solution and dig into how it can be improved.</p>

<h2 id="the-original-receive-loop">The Original Receive Loop</h2>

<p>Our Bitcoin node uses <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_tcp.html">Erlang’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span></code> module</a> to manage peer to peer communications. Originally, we were using <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span></code> in “active mode”, which means that incoming packets are delivered to our node’s Elixir process in the form of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:tcp</span></code> messages:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def handle_info({:tcp, _port, data}, state) do
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Because TCP is a streaming protocol, no guarantees can be made about the contents of these messages. A single message may contain a complete Bitcoin packet, a partial packet, multiple packets, or any combination of the above. To handle this ambiguity, the Bitcoin protocol deliminates each packet with a sequence of “magic bytes”. Once we reach this magic sequence, we know that everything we’ve received up until that point constitutes a single packet.</p>

<p>My previous receive loop worked by maintaining a backlog of all incoming bytes up until the most recently received sequence of magic bytes. Every time a new message was received, it would append those incoming bytes to the backlog and chunk that binary into a sequence of packets, which could then be handled individually:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{messages, rest} = chunk(state.rest &lt;&gt; data)

case handle_messages(messages, state) do
  {:error, reason, state} -&gt; {:disconnect, reason, %{state | rest: rest}}
  state -&gt; {:noreply, %{state | rest: rest}}
end
</code></pre>

<p>This solution works, but there are quite a few moving pieces. Not only do we have to maintain a backlog of all recently received bytes, we also have to build out the functionality to split that stream of bytes into individual packets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp chunk(binary, messages \\ []) do
  case Message.parse(binary) do
    {:ok, message, rest} -&gt;
      chunk(rest, messages ++ [message])

    nil -&gt;
      {messages, binary}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Thankfully, there’s a better way.</p>

<h2 id="taking-advantage-of-payload-length">Taking Advantage of Payload Length</h2>

<p>Every message sent through the Bitcoin protocol <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Message_structure">follows a specific format</a>.</p>

<p>The first four bytes of every packet are reserved for the network’s magic bytes. Next, twelve bytes are reserved for the name of the command being sent across the network. The next four bytes hold the length of the payload being sent, followed by a four byte partial checksum of that payload.</p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                    --><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" />

        </form>
    </div>
</div>

<p>These twenty four bytes can be found at the head of every message sent across the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, followed by the variable length binary payload representing the meat and potatoes of the command being carried out. Relying on this structure can greatly simplify our receive loop.</p>

<p>By using <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span></code> in “passive mode” (setting <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">active:</span> <span class="no">false</span></code>), incoming TCP packets won’t be delivered to our current process as messages. Instead, we can ask for packets using a blocking call to <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_tcp.html#recv-2"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">recv</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code></a>. When requesting packets, we can even specify the number of bytes we want to receive from the incoming TCP stream.</p>

<p>Instead of receiving partial messages of unknown size, we can ask <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span></code> for the next <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">24</span></code> bytes in the stream:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{:ok, message} &lt;- :gen_tcp.recv(socket, 24)
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we can parse the received <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">message</span></code> bytes and request the payload’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">size</span></code> in bytes from our socket:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{:ok, %{size: size}} &lt;- Message.parse(message),
{:ok, payload} &lt;- :gen_tcp.recv(socket, size)
</code></pre>

<p>And now we can parse and handle our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">payload</span></code>, knowing that it’s guaranteed to be a single, complete Bitcoin command sent across the peer-to-peer network.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There’s more than goes into the solution that I outlined above. For example, if we’re receiving a command like <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="sd">"</span><span class="s2">verack"</span></code>, which has a zero byte payload, asking for zero bytes from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">recv</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> will actually return all of the available bytes it has in its TCP stream.</p>

<p>Complications included, I still think this new solution is superior to our old solution of maintaining and continually chunking an ongoing stream of bytes pulled off the network.</p>

<p>If you’re eager to see the full details of the new receive loop, <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/bitcoin_network/blob/master/lib/bitcoin_network/peer/connection.ex#L80-L98">check it out on Github</a>!</p>

<p>I’d also like to thank <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin">Karl Seguin</a> for inspiring me to improve our Bitcoin node using this technique. He posted a message on <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">the Elixir Slack group</a> about prefixing TCP messages with their length to easily determine how many bytes to receive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d length prefix every message with 4 bytes and do two recvs, 
<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:ok</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">big</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="m">32</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">recv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">socket</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">TIMEOUT</span><span class="p">)</span></code>
<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:ok</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">recv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">socket</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">TIMEOUT</span><span class="p">)</span></code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one line comment opened my mind to the realization that the Bitcoin protocol was already doing this, and that I was overcomplicating the process of receiving messages.</p>

<p>Thanks Karl!</p></p>

servers, I got bitten yesterday and realized the dangers of this practice.</p>

<p>If the listening address of a server ever needs to be communicated to others
(as is the case with clustered systems), configuring <code>0.0.0.0</code> will lead to bad
things happening. That is: other servers, having learned that your address is
<code>0.0.0.0:SOMEPORT</code>, will attempt to connect and fail.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122">RFC</a> states clearly:</p>

<blockquote><p>This host on this network.  MUST NOT be sent, except as
a source address as part of an initializatioan procedure
by which the host learns its own IP address.</p></blockquote></p>

<h4><a href="https://www.anishathalye.com/2018/07/19/gemini-a-modern-beamerposter-theme/">Gemini: A Modern LaTeX Poster Theme</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Programs like PowerPoint, Keynote, and Adobe Illustrator are common tools for
designing posters, but these programs have a number of disadvantages, including
lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation">separation of content and presentation</a> and lack of
programmatic control over the output. Designing posters using these programs
can require countless hours calculating positions of elements by hand, manually
laying out content, manually propagating style changes, and repeating these
kinds of tasks over and over again during the iterative process of poster
design.</p>

<p>The idea of using a document preparation system like <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> to implement a
poster using code sounds fantastic, and indeed, there are a number of LaTeX
<a href="https://www.latextemplates.com/cat/conference-posters">templates</a> and packages for making posters, such as <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/a0poster">a0poster</a>, <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/sciposter">sciposter</a>,
and <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/beamerposter">beamerposter</a>. However, I didn’t like the look of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=latex+poster+template&tbm=isch">existing</a> themes
and templates — they all looked 20 years old — and this is what kept me
from using LaTeX for making posters, even though I had been using the software
for years for authoring documents.</p>

<p>I finally bit the bullet and spent some time designing a clean, stylish, and
minimal poster theme for LaTeX, building on top of the beamerposter package.
The result has been open-sourced as <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini">Gemini</a>, and it makes it really easy to
design posters that look like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster.pdf"><img src="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster.png" alt="Poster example" /></a></p>

<h1 id="why-latex">Why LaTeX?</h1>

<p>There are a number of programs commonly used for making academic posters. These
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Word processing programs (e.g. Word, Pages, and LibreOffice Writer)</li>
  <li>Presentation programs (e.g. PowerPoint, Keynote, and LibreOffice Impress)</li>
  <li>Vector editing programs (e.g. Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape)</li>
</ul>

<p>Why use LaTex over these programs? The biggest benefit is that LaTeX does not
require manual effort to lay out contents and apply a uniform style to the
entire poster. All layout and styling is done using code relying on TeX’s
sophisticated layout algorithms, and there is a clean separation of content and
presentation, similar to the content/style separation in HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>There are other benefits as well. TeX is a sophisticated typesetting system
that produces excellent results for text as well as mathematical formulae;
LaTeX packages provide support for <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots?lang=en">plotting</a> and algorithmically
specified <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf">diagrams and vector graphics</a>; and beamer provides support for
column-based layout, including variable-width and nested columns. This means
that all content in the poster, not just the text, can be produced using code:
no more screenshots of mathematical equations; no more positioning shapes with
the mouse to create diagrams; no more screenshots of plots where the styling
doesn’t quite match the style of the poster; and no more manual positioning of
blocks.</p>

<h1 id="a-modern-latex-poster-theme">A modern LaTeX poster theme</h1>

<p>Building posters with LaTeX is by far a better experience than using
PowerPoint, Keynote, or Illustrator. I felt that the one thing missing was an
aesthetically pleasing poster theme. There’s no reason a poster designed using
LaTeX should look any less beautiful than a poster made using graphic design
software like Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>This is what led to the creation of <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini">Gemini</a>, a LaTex poster theme with a focus
on being clean, minimal, and looking great out of the box while being
customizable:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster-gemini.pdf"><img src="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster-gemini.png" alt="Gemini default theme example" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster-mit.pdf"><img src="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster-mit.png" alt="MIT theme example" /></a></p>

<p>The theme is actually a pretty small amount of code; most of the functionality
is provided by LaTeX and beamerposter. But making conscious choices on title
and block layout, font families, font weights, color schemes, and other little
details makes a pretty big difference in how the poster looks and feels.</p></p>

<hr><h3 class="post"><a href="http://jakob.space/blog" title="Jakob's Blog">Jakob (jakob)</a></h3>


<h4><a href="http://jakob.spaceReplacing+Anki+With+org-drill">Replacing Anki With org-drill</a></h4>
<p>
<p class="indent">Recently, I read Michael Nielsen's essay, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">"Augmenting Cognition"</a>. It talks
about some very interesting use cases for the spaced repetition software "Anki"
that made me want to try it out again. I'm familiar with Anki, as I used it
extensively throughout my last year of high school to study for AP exams. At the
time, Anki's "killer feature" for me over similar software was being able to
typeset mathematical notation in LaTeX (the exams were Chemistry and Calculus,
so almost all of the material to memorize was mathematical notation). It's a
great piece of software; I've been using it with the brother I'm helping through
summer school. But ever since I began using Gentoo, I've been trying to avoid
packages like QtWebView, which has deterred me from installing Anki on my
machine. With a little bit of searching, however, I found that there was an
Emacs package for spaced repetition named 'org-drill', so I decided to check it
out.</p>
<p class="indent">org-drill is included in org by default (which happens to be included in Emacs
by default), but it does need to be enabled. The steps to do so are outlined on
the corresponding <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html">worg page</a>. So far, I've used it to study German
vocabulary and the material for my ham radio license exams, and I'm very happy
with it. It has all of the features you might want from Anki, like Cloze
deletion and double-sided cards, but I find that card creation is even more
intuitive in org markup. Clozes are as simple as enclosing the answers in square
brackets, and multi-sided cards just entail making multiple headings and setting
the ":DRILL_CARD_TYPE:". You can even write your own card types in elisp.
Another benefit of using org markup as the source for cards is that I can easily
transform a plain text file into a deck using emacs macros.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike Anki, however, org-drill has support for the SM5 and SM8 scheduling
algorithms. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#what-algorithm">Anki is quite outspoken about the benefits of SM2 over the later
renditions,</a> but I appreciate that I at least have the option to use these
schedulers if I want to. The algorithms' parameters can also be finely tuned;
the one I've found most useful is 'org-drill-learn-fraction', which I can use to
decrease the amount of time before I see a card again.</p>
<p class="indent">As I mentioned earlier, the feature that brought me to Anki was its support for
typesetting math with LaTeX. Emacs certainly has support for rendering LaTeX,
but I have a pretty wonky setup where I'm running Emacs in a terminal emulator,
so what I opted for instead was a typesetting language that renders to unicode
text. There are quite a few of these, but the one I was most impressed with is
<a href="https://arthursonzogni.com/Diagon/">Diagon</a>. It's meant to be run in the browser, but the backend is written in
C++ and can be compiled to run natively. Be warned, however, that the build
system does require Java.</p>
<p class="indent">First, I replace 'src/main.cpp' with the following. The version in VCS will
unconditionally run the SequenceTranslator, but this modification enables us to
select which translator to use from a command-line argument.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">#include &quot;translator/Translator.h&quot;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;usage: &quot; &lt;&lt; argv[0] &lt;&lt; &quot; [translator]&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::string input;
    for (std::string line; std::getline(std::cin, line);) {
        input += line + &quot;\n&quot;;
    }

    auto translator = TranslatorFromName(argv[1]);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; (*translator)(input, &quot;&quot;) &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, compiling is as easy as</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">cd tools/antlr/
./download_and_patch.sh
cd ../../
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
</code></pre>
<p>And for Emacs integration, I've added the following to my '.emacs'</p>
<pre><code class="lang-elisp">;; Applies Diagon's &quot;Math&quot; formatter to the current region, replacing
;; the contents of the region with the formatted output.
(defun format-math-at-region ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((math-to-format (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end)))
         (command (format &quot;echo \&quot;%s\&quot; | diagon Math&quot; math-to-format))) ;; Bad and hacky. I'm aware.
      (kill-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
      (insert (string-trim-right (shell-command-to-string command)))))
</code></pre>
<p>It's not as powerful as LaTeX, but it certainly suits my needs.</p>

<h4><a href="http://caiustheory.com/running-rails-tests-under-circleci-2.0-with-mariadb/">Running rails tests under CircleCI 2.0 with MariaDB</a></h4>
<p>
<p><a href="https://circleci.com">CircleCI</a> have released their version 2.0 platform, which is based on top of docker and moves the configuration for each project into a config file in the git repository.</p>

<p>They have a bunch of documentation at <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/</a>. Basic gist is the config file lives at <code>.circleci/config.yml</code> and defines which images to run a series of commands in. You can either specify jobs to run in series, or a workflow containing jobs which can depend on each other and/or run in parallel.</p>

<p>The first step is finding a base image that contains ruby, node and chrome/chromedriver so the the app runs, assets compile and rails feature specs work respectively.</p>

<p>The available images for ruby are listed at <a href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/ruby/images">https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/ruby/images</a>, and the mariadb images are listed at <a href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/mariadb/images">https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/mariadb/images</a>. For the ruby images you'll want to use the <code>…-node-browsers</code> image as it has Node.js for assets and Chrome/chromedriver installed for headless browser testing.</p>

<p>So the start of our config file looks something like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml">version<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w"></span>working_directory<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"~/project"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w"></span>docker<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>image<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"circleci/ruby:2.4.1-node-browsers"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">    </span>environment<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>RAILS_ENV<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"test"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>image<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"mariadb:10.2.12"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">    </span>environment<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>MYSQL_DATABASE<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"app_test"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>MYSQL_USER<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"root"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>MYSQL_HOST<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"localhost"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once we have that then we can start on setting up our rails environment to the point we can run tests. First of all we need to install all our ruby dependencies via <a href="https://bundler.io">bundler</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml">jobs<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> 
</span><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Install ruby dependencies"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bundle install --path vendor/bundle"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we need to install our JS dependencies via <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/">yarn</a>, in much the same way as we did for the ruby dependencies.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Install js dependencies"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"yarn install"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we need to sort out our database. There's a chance that the docker instance for MariaDB hasn't come up yet, so we can lean on a tool called <code>dockerize</code> to wait for it to be available. Then we can ask rails to go ahead and setup our test database.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Wait for database to be available"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"dockerize -wait tcp://127.0.0.1:3306 -timeout 1m"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Setup database"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bundle exec rake db:setup"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then finally we can run our tests as the final step.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Run tests"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bundle exec rspec"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Putting it all together, we have the following in <code>.circleci/config.yml</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml">version<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w">

    <p>
    After 4 months development, a design phase stretching back 10 years and
    more than 1,300 commits, I am pleased to finally announce the first stable
    series of Mitogen and the Mitogen for Ansible extension.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/">Mitogen is a Python zero-deploy
    distributed programming library</a> designed to drastically increase the
    functional capability of infrastructure software operating via SSH. <a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ansible.html">Mitogen for
    Ansible</a> is a drop-in replacement for Ansible's lower tiers, netting
    huge speed and efficiency improvements for common playbooks.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What's There</strong></p>

    <p>
    This initial series covers a widely compatible drop-in Ansible extension on
    Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.6, a preview of the first value-added functionality
    for Ansible (<a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ansible.html#connection-delegation">Connection
    Delegation</a>), and a freeze of the underlying library required to support
    it.
    </p>

    <p>
    With the exception of some gotchas listed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html">release
    notes</a>, you should expect the Ansible extension to <em>just work</em>,
    and if it doesn't <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/yLKZiJ">please let me know via
    GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Demo</strong></p>

    <p>
    Refer to the posts under <em>Just Tuning In?</em> below for a 1000 foot
    view of the direction this work is heading, but for an idea of how things
    are today, watch the first minute of this recording, demonstrating a
    loop-heavy configuration of Mitogen's tests executing against the local
    machine.
    </p>

    <p>
    
        
    
    </p>

    <p><strong>Installation</strong></p>

    <p>
    To install Mitogen for Ansible, just follow the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ansible.html#installation">5
    easy steps</a></strong> in the documentation. For non-Ansible users the
    library is available from PyPI via <code>pip install mitogen</code>.
    Introductory documentation for the library is very weak right now, it will
    improve over the course of the stable series.
    </p>

    <!--
    <p><strong>Early User Feedback</strong></p>

    <ul>
    <li>"With mitogen <strong>my playbook runtime went from 45 minutes to just
        under 3 minutes</strong>. Awesome work!"</li>
    <li>"The runtime was reduced from <strong>1.5 hours on 4 servers to just
        under 3 minutes</strong>. Thanks!"</li>
    <li>"Oh, performance improvement using Mitogen is <strong>huge</strong>. As
        mentioned before, running with Mitogen enables takes 7m36 (give or take
        a few seconds). Without Mitogen, the same run takes 19m49! <strong>I'm not
        even deploying without Mitogen anymore</strong> :)"</li>
    <li>"<strong>Works like a charm</strong>, thank you for your quick response"</li>
    <li>"I tried it out. <strong>He is not kidding about the speed
        increase</strong>."
    <li>"I don't know what kind of dark magic @dmw_83 has done, but his Mitogen
        strategy took Clojars' Ansible runs from <strong>14 minutes to 2
        minutes</strong>. I still can't quite believe it."</li>

    Feature work will resume after most issues are ironed out of the stable

    complete and widely compatible Connection Delegation feature, including a
    rewrite of the <code>fakessh</code> component to support transparent use of
    the <code>synchronize</code> module.

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/09/golfing-for-fizzbuzz-in-clojure-and-elixir/">Golfing for FizzBuzz in Clojure and Elixir</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I recently came across <a href="https://gist.github.com/krisajenkins/3333741">this riff on the FizzBuzz problem written in Clojure</a>. While it’s admittedly not terribly obvious what’s going on, I thought it was a novel solution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">the FizzBuzz problem</a>.</p>

<p>How could we recreate this solution using <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>? There are some obvious similarities between Clojure’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">cycle</span></code> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#cycle/1">Elixir’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cycle</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code></a>. As someone who’s always been a fanboy of Lisp syntax, which solution would I prefer?</p>

<p>There’s only one way to find out…</p>

<h2 id="but-first-an-explanation">But First, an Explanation</h2>

<p>Before we dive into our Elixir solution, we should work out what exactly this Clojure solution is doing:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
(clojure.pprint/pprint
  (map vector
    (range 25)
    (cycle [:fizz :_ :_])
    (cycle [:buzz :_ :_ :_ :_])))
</code></pre>

<p>Clojure’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">clojure</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pprint</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">pprint</span></code> obviously just prints whatever’s passed into it. In this case, we’re printing the result of this expression:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
(map vector
  (range 25)
  (cycle [:fizz :_ :_])
  (cycle [:buzz :_ :_ :_ :_])))
</code></pre>

<p>But what exactly’s happening here? Clojure’s <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">map</span></code></a> function is interesting. It let’s you map a function over any number of collections. The result of the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">map</span></code>  expression is the result of applying the function to each of the first values of each collection, followed by the result of applying the mapped function to each of the second values, and so on.</p>

<p>In this case, we’re mapping the <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/vector"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">vector</span></code></a> function over three collections: the range of numbers from zero to twenty four (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">range</span> <span class="m">25</span><span class="p">)</span></code>), <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/cycle">the infinite cycle</a> of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:fizz</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code>, and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code> (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cycle</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:fizz</span> <span class="ss">:_</span> <span class="ss">:_</span><span class="p">])</span></code>), and the infinite cycle of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:buzz</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code> (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cycle</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:buzz</span> <span class="ss">:_</span> <span class="ss">:_</span> <span class="ss">:_</span> <span class="ss">:_</span><span class="p">])</span></code>).</p>

<p>Mapping <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">vector</span></code> over each of these collections creates a vector for each index, and whether it should display Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz for that particular index.</p>

<p>The result looks just like we’d expect:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
([0 :fizz :buzz]
 [1 :_ :_]
 [2 :_ :_]
 [3 :fizz :_]
 [4 :_ :_]
 [5 :_ :buzz]
 ...
 [24 :fizz :_])
</code></pre>

<h2 id="an-elixir-solution">An Elixir Solution</h2>

<p>So how would we implement this style of FizzBuzz solution using Elixir? As we mentioned earlier, Elixir’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cycle</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function is almost identical to Clojure’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">cycle</span></code>. Let’s start there.</p>

<p>We’ll make two cycles of our Fizz and Buzz sequences:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Stream.cycle([:fizz, :_, :_])
Stream.cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_])
</code></pre>

<p>On their own, these two cycles don’t do much.</p>

<p>Let’s use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#zip/2"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zip</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code></a> to effectively perform the same operation as Clojure’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">map</span> <span class="n">vector</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Stream.zip(Stream.cycle([:fizz, :_, :_]), Stream.cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_])) 
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can print the first twenty five pairs by piping our zipped streams into <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">take</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> and printing the result with <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">IO</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">inspect</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Stream.zip(Stream.cycle([:fizz, :_, :_]), Stream.cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_])) 
|&gt; Enum.take(25)
|&gt; IO.inspect
</code></pre>

<p>Our result looks similar:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[
  fizz: :buzz,
  _: :_,
  _: :_,
  fizz: :_,
  _: :_,
  _: :buzz,
  ...
  fizz: :_
]
</code></pre>

<p>While our solution works, I’m not completely happy with it.</p>

<h2 id="polishing-our-solution">Polishing Our Solution</h2>

<p>For purely aesthetic reasons, let’s import the function’s we’re using from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">IO</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
import Stream, only: [cycle: 1, zip: 2]
import Enum, only: [take: 2]
import IO, only: [inspect: 1]
</code></pre>

<p>This simplifies the visual complexity of our solution:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
zip(cycle([:fizz, :_, :_]), cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_]))
|&gt; take(25)
|&gt; inspect
</code></pre>

<p>But we can take it one step further.</p>

<div class="post-footer">

            </div>

        </form>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Rather than using <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zip</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>, which expects a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">left</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">right</span></code> argument, let’s use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#zip/1"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zip</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code></a>, which expects to be passed an enumerable of streams:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[
  cycle([:fizz, :_, :_]),
  cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_])
]
|&gt; zip
|&gt; take(25)
|&gt; inspect
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s our final solution.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>To be honest, I’ve been having troubles lately coming to terms with some of Elixir’s aesthetic choices. As someone who’s always admired the simplicity of Lisp syntax, I fully expected myself to prefer the Clojure solution over the Elixir solution.</p>

<p>That being said, I hugely prefer the Elixir solution we came up with!</p>

<p>The overall attack plan of the algorithm is much more apparent. It’s immediately clear that we start with two cycles of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:fizz</span></code>/<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:buzz</span></code> and some number of empty atoms. From there, we zip together the streams and take the first twenty five results. Lastly, we inspect the result.</p>

<p>Which solution do you prefer?</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/09/ping-pong-and-unresponsive-bitcoin-nodes/">Ping, Pong, and Unresponsive Bitcoin Nodes</a></h4>
<p>
<p>The last piece of low-hanging fruit required to finish up the connectivity of our in-progress, <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir-powered</a> Bitcoin node is to implement a system to detect unresponsive peer connections and prune them from our list of active peers.</p>

<p>Once an inactive peer is removed, our current system will automatically connect to a new peer to take its place.</p>

<p>There are several potential solutions for building out this kind of timeout system, and I’ve been weighing their pros and cons in the back of my mind for several weeks. I think I’ve come to a relatively simple and elegant solution that tackles the problem with minimal technical and mental overhead.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="who-cares-about-unresponsive-nodes">Who Cares About Unresponsive Nodes?</h2>

<p>In its current state, our Bitcoin node will connect to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/23e7fe8be827cdcdcace2a77ecc683074b97f8a2/src/net.h#L70-L71">up to one hundred twenty five peer nodes</a>. We assume that each of these nodes is a fully functioning and active part of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. If we don’t receive any messages from them, or if messages dwindle over time, we just assume that the network doesn’t have much to tell us.</p>

<p>This assumption can lead to trouble. If we continue to persist our connections to unresponsive nodes, it’s conceivable that eventually every node we’re connected to will become unresponsive for some reason or another.</p>

<p>At that point, our Bitcoin node is dead in the water. It’s unable to send or receive any information, and it’s unable to fetch any additional peers to reestablish its place in the peer-to-peer network. At this point our only course of action would be to restart the node and try again.</p>

<p>And that’s not a very robust solution…</p>

<h2 id="detecting-slow-connections">Detecting Slow Connections</h2>

<p>Instead, we should be proactive about pruning unresponsive nodes from our set of peers. The first piece of low hanging fruit was can go after is adding a timeout to our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> call:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
:gen_tcp.connect(
  IP.to_tuple(state.ip),
  state.port,
  options,
  Application.get_env(:bitcoin_network, :timeout)
)
</code></pre>

<p>If a node takes too long to respond to our initial connection request (in this case, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code> is set to thirty seconds), we’ll retry the connection a few times and then ultimately remove the node from our set of peers.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-unresponsive-nodes">Detecting Unresponsive Nodes</h2>

<p>The next step in aggressively pruning our peer list is to watch for unresponsive nodes. We’ll do this by setting up a timeout between every message we receive from our peer. If we don’t receive another message before a certain cutoff time, we deem the peer unresponsive and break our connection.</p>

<p>We’ll start by adding a call to a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">refresh_timeout</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper function in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:tcp</span></code> info handler:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def handle_info({:tcp, _port, data}, state) do
  state = refresh_timeout(state)
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first time <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">refresh_timeout</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> is called, it schedules a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code> message to be sent to the current process after a certain amount of time. A reference to that timer is stored in the process’ current state:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp refresh_timeout(state) do
  timer = Process.send_after(self(), :timeout, Application.get_env(:bitcoin_network, :timeout))
  Map.put_new(state, :timer, timer)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Subsequent calls to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">refresh_timeout</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> cancel the existing timer, and create a new one:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp refresh_timeout(state = %{timer: timer}) do
  Process.cancel_timer(timer)
  refresh_timeout(Map.delete(state, :timer))
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to add a callback to handle the scheduled <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code> message:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def handle_info(:timeout, state) do
  {:disconnect, :timeout, state}
end
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever we receive a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code> message, we simply kill the current process, effectively disconnecting the associated peer.</p>

<h2 id="ensuring-a-constant-stream-of-messages">Ensuring A Constant Stream of Messages</h2>

<p>So now we’re disconnecting peers if we don’t receive a message from them within a certain period of time (thirty seconds in my case), but we have no way of guaranteeing that we <em>should</em> receive messages this frequently. What if there are no new blocks or transactions on the network?</p>

<p>To guarantee what we receive regular periodic messages, we need to set up a ping/pong loop.</p>

<p>Every so often we’ll send our peer node a “ping” message. If they’re still responsive, they’ll immediately respond with a “pong”. The peer will ensure our responsiveness by sending their own “pings”, which we’re already responding to.</p>

<p>According to the woefully under-documented Bitcoin protocol, we can’t send our first “ping” until we send back our “verack” message. Any messages sent prior to our “verack” will mark our node as “misbehaving” and risk a disconnection.</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp handle_payload(%Version{}, state) do
  with :ok &lt;- Message.serialize("verack") |&gt; send_message(state.socket),
       :ok &lt;- Message.serialize("getaddr") |&gt; send_message(state.socket),
       :ok &lt;-
         Message.serialize("ping", %Ping{
           nonce: :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(8)
         })
         |&gt; send_message(state.socket) do
    {:ok, state}
  else
    {:error, reason} -&gt; {:error, reason, state}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we’ve sent our “ping”, we can expect to receive a “pong” in reply. When we receive the peer’s “pong” response, we want to schedule another “ping” to be sent a short time in the future. We do this by scheduling a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:send_ping</span></code> message to be sent to the current process after a short interval:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp handle_payload(%Pong{}, state) do
  Process.send_after(self(), :send_ping, Application.get_env(:bitcoin_network, :ping_time))
  {:ok, state}
end
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:send_ping</span></code> handler sends another “ping” message, completing the ping/pong cycle:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def handle_info(:send_ping, state) do
  with :ok &lt;-
         Message.serialize("ping", %Ping{
           nonce: :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(8)
         })
         |&gt; send_message(state.socket) do
    {:noreply, state}
  else
    {:error, reason} -&gt; {:error, reason, state}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s all there is to it!</p>

<p>As long as <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:ping_time</span></code> is reasonably less than our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code>, we should always have a constant stream of “ping” messages to keep our timeout timer from firing. If one of our peers ever fails to send their “pong”, we kill their corresponding <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Node</span></code> process.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As far as I’m concerned, that wraps up the networking portion of our in-progress Elixir-based Bitcoin node project. In the future we’ll turn our attention to the actual guts of a Bitcoin node: processing blocks and transactions.</p>

<p>At some point we might also slap a fancy user interface on top of our node. Everything’s better with a great UI.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p></p>

<p>
<p>This continues a series where we make a debugger and live editor for (re)creating assembly and C programs.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.asrpo.com/making_a_low_level_debugger">part 1</a>, we got the assembly parts: read/write registers and memory, single step, single instruction execution, function calls (although not perfect), set/restore breakpoints, memory allocation and examining upcoming instructions.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.asrpo.com/making_a_low_level_debugger_part_2">part 2</a>, we got the C parts: read/write variables using ptrace and memory maps, a C read-eval-print loop (REPL), line numbers from DWARF headers and undo using <code>fork()</code>.</p>

<p>Its now time to actually use our debugger/editor! We'll try to use it to write a C program.</p></p>
